<h1> Introduction</h1>
</br>
Different cultures typically offer different, often contradicting each other belief systems. To explain these
contradictions, one can adopt the monoverse perspective claiming the existence of only one real world and only one true
description of that world. An alternative approach, developed and advocated in this manuscript, builds on the vision of
many worlds and many equally valid descriptions of these worlds. This particular viewpoint will be referred to here as
the multiverse perspective. </br>
</br>
I will argue in this manuscript that the multiverse viewpoint epistemologically is not any less plausible than that
based on the monoverse vision. In other words, the weight of arguments in support of the multiverse is compatible to the
weight of arguments advocating the monoverse. Furthermore, I believe, the multiverse outperforms the monoverse in terms
of the aesthetic appeal, openness to innovations, and utility to our practices. The multiverse theory provides an
umbrella-framework overarching individual belief systems and reconciling them with each other. This framework is
particularly suitable for accommodating multi-culture societies.</br>
</br>
To guide the development of this framework, I shall introduce the Instantiated Storied Object (ISO) machinery – a set of
assumptions and principles concerning the structure and functioning of this multiverse. According to the ISO machinery,
to create a new entity (be it a particular item or the whole new artificial world) one has to design it first, and then
implement that design in practice, and finally test and maintain it. This strategy works perfectly well with artificial
systems such as physical aggregates and social constructs, but it does not apply to natural systems. To generalise it
towards natural systems, I will introduce further assumptions and constraints concerning ontological foundations of this
multiverse. The end-product of these developments is a multiverse made out of many different belief systems and
communities of practitioners. Each belief represents a particular world instantiated through human practices. All worlds
together share the same universe of natural systems. Unlike monoverse worlds, where only one world is real, in the
multiverse there are many different equally real worlds, each world having its own Gods (if any), afterlife, customs
etc. Furthermore, new artificial worlds can be designed and instantiated from scratch when needed.

Despite a fair bit of philosophy present in this manuscript, I should warn the reader that I am not a professional
philosopher and the lack of a systematic education in this area is likely to be noticeable throughout this book. The
text could be missing important references or it may zoom in on issues considered trivial by philosophers. On the other
hand, it was never my intention to write another philosophical treatise. The goal was to clarify to myself what we know
and what we do not about ourselves and the world around us, and then figure out how we can design a better
description of these items.
</br></br>
This manuscript touches upon some controversial philosophical issues concerning the epistemological and metaphysical
foundations of our beliefs. The scope of the undertaking is huge. To handle this complexity, I had two options to choose
from. One was to pick up a particular component of this theory and dedicate all my time to investigating and refining it.
Another option was to design and deliver the whole theory at once. In the first case, there was a risk that the polished
component of the new theory will not make sense against the contextual background of the established paradigms. In the
later case, there was a risk of not delivering the whole theory at all or making it too shallow. I have placed a bet on
the second option and, I hope, have made first steps towards establishing a multiverse framework which is sufficiently
sound and complete in a sense that major parts fit together and the whole makes sense. The framework, however, is far 
from being complete - there are rough patches, inconsistencies and loose ends to tie up. 
Furthermore, the text of this manuscript has been neither edited nor reviewed (as of May 2019).
</br></br>
The writings of many people have influenced the choices I have made throughout this book. Richard Rorty’s “Philosophy
and the mirror of nature” and “Contingency, irony and solidarity” were instrumental in shaking my belief in the
foundational status of epistemology. McIntyre’s “After virtue” opened the door into the world of virtue ethics and Peter
Berger’s “The social construction of reality: a treatise in the sociology of knowledge” inspired the design of the
multiverse. Apart from these three thinkers, there are many others referred to in this book to whom I am indebted for
steering the direction of my thought and inspiring me with new ideas. Special thank goes to my family - without their
support I would not be able to complete this project.
</br></br>
Outline of the content. The book consists of this Introduction, 5 chapters, Appendixes and References. Chapters 1 and 2
introduce the vocabulary and highlight the problem - none of the established monoverse theories of the world 
are fully justified. These theories do not converge towards one single truth. Subsequently,
contradictions between different belief systems remain unresolved. A number of multiverse theories have been developed 
and advocated recently is academic circles (e.g. possible worlds in philosophy, multiverse theories in physics) but none 
of these has sufficient empirical grounds to challenge the established monoverse theories. 
In chapter 3 i shall introduce the Instantiated Storied Object (ISO) machinery – the key engine driving the development 
of the storied multiverse. Chapter 4 introduces a storied multiverse and also summarises arguments for and against 
this theory. Chapter 5 concludes this manuscript.
