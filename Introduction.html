<h1> Introduction</h1>
</br>
Different cultures typically offer different, often contradicting each other belief systems. To explain these
contradictions, one can adopt the monoverse perspective claiming the existence of only one real world and only one true
description of that world. An alternative approach, developed and advocated in this manuscript, builds on the vision of
many worlds and many equally valid descriptions of these worlds. This particular viewpoint will be referred to here as
the multiverse perspective. </br>
</br>
I will argue in this manuscript that the multiverse viewpoint epistemologically is not any less plausible than that
based on the monoverse vision. In other words, the weight of arguments in support of the multiverse is compatible to the
weight of arguments advocating the monoverse. Furthermore, I believe, the multiverse outperforms the monoverse in terms
of the aesthetic appeal, openness to innovations, and utility to our practices. The multiverse theory provides an
umbrella-framework overarching individual belief systems and reconciling them with each other. This framework is
particularly suitable for accommodating multi-culture societies.</br>
</br>
To guide the development of this framework, I shall introduce the Instantiated Storied Object (ISO) machinery – a set of
assumptions and principles concerning the structure and functioning of this multiverse. According to the ISO machinery,
to create a new entity (be it a particular item or the whole new artificial world) one has to design it first, then
implement that design in practice, and finally test and maintain it. This strategy works perfectly well with artificial
systems such as physical aggregates and social constructs, but it does not apply to natural systems. To generalise it
towards natural systems, I shall introduce further assumptions and constraints concerning ontological foundations of this
multiverse. The end-product of these developments is a multiverse made out of many different belief systems and
communities of practitioners. Each belief represents a particular world instantiated through human practices. All worlds
together share the same universe of natural systems. Unlike monoverse worlds, where only one world is real, in the
multiverse there are many different equally real worlds, each world having its own Gods (if any), afterlife, customs
etc. Furthermore, new artificial worlds can be designed and instantiated from scratch when needed.
</br></br>
Despite a fair bit of philosophy present in this manuscript, I should warn the reader that I am not a professional
philosopher and the lack of the systematic education in this area is likely to be noticeable throughout this book. The
text could be missing important references or it may zoom in on issues considered trivial by philosophers. On the other
hand, it was never my intention to write another philosophical treatise. The goal was to clarify to myself what we know
and what we do not about ourselves and the world around us, and then figure out how we can design a better
description of these items.
</br></br>
This manuscript touches upon some controversial philosophical issues concerning the epistemological and metaphysical
foundations of our beliefs. The scope of the undertaking is huge. To handle this complexity, I had two options to choose
from. One was to pick up a particular component of this theory and dedicate all my time to investigating and refining it.
Another option was to design and deliver the whole theory at once. In the first case, there was a risk that the polished
component of the new theory will not make sense against the contextual background of the established paradigms. In the
later case, there was a risk of not delivering the whole theory at all or making it too shallow. I have placed a bet on
the second option and, I hope, have made first steps towards establishing a multiverse framework which is sufficiently
sound and complete in a sense that major parts fit together and the whole makes sense. The framework, however, is far 
from being complete - there are rough patches, inconsistencies and loose ends to tie up. 
Furthermore, the text of this manuscript has been neither edited nor reviewed (as of May 2019).
</br></br>
The writings of many people have influenced the choices I have made throughout this book. Richard Rorty’s “Philosophy
and the mirror of nature” and “Contingency, irony and solidarity” were instrumental in shaking my belief in the
foundational status of epistemology. McIntyre’s “After virtue” opened the door into the world of virtue ethics and Peter
Berger’s “The social construction of reality: a treatise in the sociology of knowledge” inspired the design of the
multiverse. Apart from these three thinkers, there are many others referred to in this book to whom I am indebted for
steering the direction of my thought and inspiring me with new ideas. Special thank goes to my family - without their
support I would not be able to complete this project.

Outline of the content. The book consists of this Introduction, 5 chapters, Appendixes and References. 
Chapter 1 defines the notion of the Storied World - a building block of the multiverse, 
and illustrates it through a number of examples.
It highlights contradictions an irreducible component of these storied worlds leading 
to a conclusion that none of the established worlds (belief systems) are fully justified
(at least from the epistemological perspective). 

<br><br>
In Chapter 2, first we discuss arguments for and against physical reductionism and then 
dig into metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. THe material in this chapter is based on the university 
text-books in philosophy. The goal is to highlight a normative component inherent to 
many problems in philosophy thus contributing to their ampliative nature  
(i.e. conclusions often going beyond of what is contained in premises).
The section on ethics is to introduce virtues and good-life as notions 
complementary to the notion of truth and indicative of the quality of storied worlds
comprising the multiverse.

<br><br>
In Chapter 3 we introduce the Instantiated Storied Object (ISO) machinery – the key engine 
driving the development of the storied multiverse. 
ISO machinery explains cycling between abstract and particular domains and
provides a schema for creating new objects in multiverse. 
Two key points underpin this schema <br>
1) a definition of the real entity, which is, on the one hand, general enough to accommodate storied worlds, and 
on the other hand, sufficiently specific so that we can prove features characteristic 
of the real entity through reproducible practices.  <br>
2) an assumption of the superpositional nature of the multiverse, which enables us to generalise ISO machinery from 
the realm of the conventional artificial systems to natural systems.

<br><br>
To avoid contradictions, we complement the ISO machinery
with the ordering constrain (the first instance rules), and 
the privacy constrain (one is a master of his / her own fate).  

<br><br>
The ISO machinery defines ontology, cosmology, and metaphysics of the multiverse. 
Chapter 4.1 introduces the inhabitants of this multiverse - sizmarians 
who instantiate and maintain this multiverse through the collective efforts.
Community support is critical for the successful progression of this project.

<br><br>
Sizmarians are migrants travelling from one culture to another and often stuck in between two worlds - 
they belong neither one nor another culture. Instead, they live in a multiverse.
This multiverse, populated by individual worlds, is filled with a vast void separating these worlds from each other. 
There is no light, no heat, no meaning in this empty, cold space 
and unless you learn to instantiate all these by yourself, out of nothing, 
you are sucked into the abyss of the existential vacuum - it is almost impossible to live here 
and it is almost impossible to get out of there. 
To maintain the quality of your life, you can play safe and stick with a particular storied-world
and never go outside. An alternative option is a prior sustainable well-being developed 
through the character building. This prior well-being provides an insulation from the existential vacuum 
thus enabling sizmarians to travel across the multiverse.      

<br><br>
The notion of the prior sustainable well-being is also instrumental to the notion 
of the good life of sizmarians - a key function expected from the multiverse. 
Since the good life is a life of the virtuous person, virtuous behavior is inherent to sizmarians.

<br><br>
Finally this section introduces the notion of the prior goodness permeating the whole multiverse 
and transcending the well-being of individual sizmarians.


<br><br>
Chapter 4.2 gives a short overview of established multiverse theories and 
summarises arguments for and against the storied multiverse. 

<br><br>
Chapter 5 concludes this manuscript.
