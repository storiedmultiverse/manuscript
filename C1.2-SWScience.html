<h3>SW of science</h3>
We can define science as a social practice dealing with a coherent body of knowledge and evolving it towards higher
states of completeness. Despite an optimistic attitude shining through this definition, there are reasons to believe
that the whole enterprise of science is a permanent transition from one incoherent state to another. Let’s have a closer
look on the SW of science.
<br><br>
Ontology. What is out there?
According to science, the universe is filled up with particles, the void, and the energy which moves these particles
around. The motion of particles for the most part is not random but obeys certain rules. Anything else (a human being,
society, love, morals, faith, etc) is, in principle, reducible to these four (particles, the void, the energy, and the
rules).
<br><br>
Cosmology. How does it work?
There was a big explosion called Big-Bang about 14 billion years ago, and all matter suddenly appeared in the Universe.
Unlike conventional explosions, this one didn’t have the point of origin, instead through this explosion the space
itself was created and everything just appeared everywhere in the universe. One of the consequences of such creation is
that there is no such thing as a centre of the universe. Or alternatively, if you prefer, you may call any place in the
Universe (including Earth) its centre. For some unknown reasons the space of the Universe keeps expanding at
accelerating rate meaning that all planets and stars are speeding away from our planet (as well as from any other
planet). The further away the faster they move. Eventually they all will be gone beyond the cosmological horizon and
there will be no stars left on the sky. On the other hand, our knowledge of these phenomena is so limited, that all
long-term projections must be considered with a fair bit of scepticism - we do not know what will happen in the distant
future.
<br><br>
After initial cooling and condensation following the Big-Bang, most of the matter was spread all over the universe in
the form of light particles and electro-magnetic waves. Gravitational forces pulled these particles together and formed
galaxies and stars. Stars when exploding crated heavier elements – building blocks of planets. The planet Earth has
formed about 4.5 billion years ago. When the physics and chemistry were right, life has started on its surface and
evolved from single prokaryote cells into more complex organisms including mammals which at some stage culminated in
humans.
<br><br>
On a microscopic level, the life of particles is governed by the laws of probability. In fact, there are no particles as
such but the clouds of probability for a particle to appear at this or that point. Almost anything is possible in this
strange micro-world. Particles can pop up out of nowhere, they may feel each other at distance immediately, or penetrate
impenetrable barriers. There are rules governing their behaviour and no one knows why these rules rather than some
other, and what they mean, if such question makes any sense at all.
<br><br>
In between these two extremes (macro and micro scales) there is a world of natural and social sciences dealing with
objects which are neither too big nor too small - the world of meso-scale phenomena studied by classical physics,
chemistry, biology, humanities, sociology. Natural sciences have been quite successful in explaining and predicting many
natural phenomena. More complex social constructs proved to be more challenging – we often neither understand them nor
can predict their behaviour.
<br><br>
Metaphysics. Why does it exist?
Science can tell you how some parts of the universe work, but cannot tell you why the universe is there and why it works
this way rather than another. Particles, the void, the energy and the rules are all out there, given by the nature
(whatever this word could mean) to be discovered and analysed by scientists. The question “Why all planets follow the
Newton’s laws and not some other set of equations?” is beyond the scope of, at least, the mainstream science.
<br><br>
It does make sense to ask this question in a multiverse version of the world, entertained by some scientists, but then
the next question “Why this specific multiverse and not something else?” completes the cycle and again suspends us in
nothingness. To circumvent this problem, an American philosopher Nozick (1981) introduced the fecundity principle
according to which there is an infinite number of universes out there and for any theoretical construct, however
hypothetical or wild and unrealistic, there is a physical counterpart hiding somewhere in this multiverse. The question
“Why this universe or this equation rather than another?” is then answered with the reference to pure chance: “There are
many other possible universes but it just happened that we inhabit this one”. If you press further “Why this
multiverse?”, the answer is “Because this one is the most complete (it is all inclusive)”. It is not obvious that such
an all-inclusive multiverse is the most useful kind of the multiverse, but in principle, from this manifold you can
subsample a multiverse of any shape and any function to satisfy almost any requirement.
<br><br>
Identity. What is a human being?
A human being is just a bundle of particles and biogeochemical reactions which sustain a kind of autonomous existence
for about 70-90 years and then disintegrate into more basic ingredients. A Self or a person is just a tag we attach to
that structured bundle nested into a social milieu. When the structure disintegrates, nothing is left behind, the person
in gone.
<br><br>
Practices. What is s/he doing?
According to science, about 200 thousand years ago human beings were anatomically indistinguishable from modern people
and lived under freezing ice-age conditions. Over the last 10 thousand years improved climates of Holocene made it
possible to cross the line between the poverty and debilitating struggle of everyday survival towards the relative
stability and freedom. People started exploring dimensions of the self and the nature beyond the limits of that defined
by the biological necessities. They got busy building civilisations, discovering new knowledge and conquering the
nature. Over the last 300 years they made great advances in sciences and technologies. New model of the universe
replaced an awkward and complicated Earth centred Ptolemaic model, Newton’s laws made it possible to navigate spaceships
towards other planets, Mendeleev’s rules of the periodic table and Darwin’s theory of the evolution made possible new
inventions and discoveries in chemistry and genetics. The classical physics of meso-scale phenomena has been extended to
describe the world of the elementary particles and the whole universe. Computers and internet revolutionised
communications and information storage. Progresses in humanities, economics, and social science lead toward better
social structures with democratic governments caring (or at least pretending to care) about human rights and justice.
The life span of a human being has been extended tremendously and the quality of the life was improved as well (at least
in the developed countries).
<br><br>
Note that this description of the progress made by science is not unique. An alternative account of modern days would be
that of the nostalgia and mourning about the lost beauty of the pristine relationship between members of a small
(perhaps agrarian) community and the nature. The progress in science and technology is destroying the natural flow of
things and introducing unwanted anomalies into otherwise the right order of the universe and the society. Weapons of
mass destruction, spread of pollutants, global warming, fake news all these aspects contribute to this story line.
Another interpretation of science is a story integrating positive and pessimistic attitudes into a more comprehensive
and diverse description of the scientific affairs acknowledging its strong and weak points. The reader interested in
further examples of stories like this is directed to Christian Smith’s “Moral, Believing, Animal” (2009).
<br><br>
Values. Why s/he is doing it?
What is the purpose of life? A kind of an embarrassing question which adults normally never ask in modern society.
Science tells us that there is no answer to this question. Or more accurately, different people have different answers
and there is no common ground to reconcile their opinions. Yet, if we leave aside the task of the reconciliation, within
a single storied-world this question is absolutely legitimate and in most cases (except some pathology) could be
answered.
<br><br>
The storied-world of science could be an example of such pathology, at least formally, unless the scientist is prepared
to break outside the prison of his logic. Scientists cannot answer this question because within the realms of science
life does not make sense. We have a temporary bundle of structured particles and biogeochemical reactions, called a
person. On a geological time-scale the life span of this bundle is so short that even “the blink of an eye” does not
make a proper metaphor. We came from nothing and in no-time return to that nothing. The world is just an illusion. The
same comment is likely to generalise for the whole phenomena of life, and perhaps for the whole universe. Why do we care
about something which is already almost gone? Is it just because it is a basic instinct hardwired in our genes? All
other people who did not have it are gone because they were too rational and did not have stamina to fight? In this
universe of science the reason tells us that life makes no sense and has no value. Instincts push forward and demand us
to stand up and fight when needed. Are we the people of reason or animals governed by our instincts? Are we to live or
we just die?
<br><br>
Science is not capable of filling in this gape, and yet, it does not mean that the gap is left open and the question of
the meaning of life has not being answered. The answer varied with time depending upon conditions prevailing in a given
society for a particular time period. For ancient Greek philosophers a philosophical contemplation was good enough to
exhaust the task of defining the purpose of life. For a general public (not philosophers), during extreme events (war,
natural disaster), the task of survival is taken for granted without further questioning - there is no time to seek for
higher order motivations and purposes to justify resistance, for example. Under normal no-war condition, nowadays
particularly, I believe, what happens in developed countries is that the search of the meaning of life has moved beyond
the realms of science and religion/tradition into the realms of art. Disbelief in big stories cleared space for new
developments transcend the reason and establishing new grounds for this enquiry. Starting with Foucault’s “man as a
product of art” a human being and his life are increasingly considered and assessed as the products of art rather than
attributes hardwired to a particular description of the universe. In the world of science there is no metaphysics.
Afterlife, morals and ethics are not well defined. But all these notions are perfectly at home in the realms of art
which transcends the mechanistic world of science and has a capacity to introduce and sustain meaning and values.
<br><br>
Narrative
The aforementioned stories about the world of science integrate nicely into a narrative structure which has the
beginning, the mid-part, and the final part. There might be some variations to the content of this story induced by
different schools of scientific though (e.g. multiverse vs monoverse interpretations), but the mainstream school rules.
The subject area is well defined, anything beyond that area is ignored. There was and there is ongoing progress in
accumulating new knowledge within the established domain of the research.
<br><br>
Now that we have an outline of the storied-world of science, let’s have a closer look on contradictions. To guide us in
this area, I will take the list of major unresolved problems in science as published by special issue of “Science”
magazine (Science, vol 309, 2005). The list they have compiled is not perfect and have been criticised for being tilted
towards physics and biology with much less attention paid to, for instance, math, social sciences, or computer science.
Yet, it is still instructive. In what follow, I present some of the items included in this list.
<br><br>
<i>Contradictions and open questions in science</i>
<ul>
<li>The story of the universe is not complete. We have no idea what was before the big-bang and what awaits the universe
in the distant future? Perhaps, there was nothing before the big-bang happened and then everything just popped up out of
nothing. Or there was something, but no one knows what exactly that something was. </li>
<li>What is the universe made of? A large body of evidence has been accumulated over the last decades indicating that the
mass of all visible materials in galaxies is not sufficient to explain rotation of these galaxies. There must be more
matter inside them to keep planets and stars together and avoid centrifuginal disruption. That missing invisible matter
was called an ordinary dark matter. On a much larger scale it appeared that more invisible mass is required to explain
the dynamics of galaxies. The problem was again too much empty space and lack of mass to keep these galaxies together.
Another kind of dark matter was introduced called exotic dark material. As if this was not enough, astronomers
discovered that the universe is expanding with accelerating speed. The unknown force that cases this acceleration was
called dark energy. Very little is known about the nature of the dark matter and even less is known about the dark
energy. All this invisible and pretty much unknown ingredients of the world make up about 96 % of its mass. In other
words, all science we have had so far was about understanding and explaining a fraction of the universe comprising only
4% of its mass.</li>
<li>Why the micro-world is so strange and counterintuitive? Waves – particle duality, non-locality, probabilistic nature,
entanglement. Could it be another “Ptolemaic” model of the universe waiting to be replaced with more simple and accurate
description?</li>
<li>Why the progress in understanding and predicting complex systems (alive creatures, social systems) is so poor? Is
science picking low hanging fruits?</li>
<li>Why we still do not have a unifying theory of all physical forces? Until we have it, the theory of physics remains
inconsistent because there are no connections between different parts of this story.</li>
<li>Why science is silent about morals and purpose of life?</li>
<li>Why there are no aliens? There is plenty of space and was plenty of time for them to develop civilisations and show
<li>Nick Bostrom (Swedish philosopher from Oxford) speculates there might be a cap, such that as soon civilisation
reaches certain stage of development it destroys itself. But we do not know for sure.
<li>Do we live in a multiverse?</li>
<li>Ontological foundations. Is an information a basic building block of the Universe?</li>
<li>Origin of life. No one knows exactly how life developed on Earth. The probability that DNK and proteins have created
spontaneously is negligibly small. Biologists hypothesise about intermediate step of a smaller complexity (based on RNK)
which may have preceded creation of DNK and proteins, but all this remains hypothetical. No one so far succeeded
creating life from abiotic components and the hypothesis of extraterrestrial origin (panspermia) remains a plausible
alternative to that of the self-creation on Earth.</li>
<li>Why physics speaks math? Richard Rorty said that nature does not speak Newtonian, people do. However, it does look
like some parts of the nature, if not speak then definitely follow math. The motion of planets, electro-magnetic waves,
thermodynamics, quantum mechanics etc. It looks like any coherent math system is destined to have some physical
counterpart. Why this is so? Why these systems behave as if they materialise math algorithms? As if the physics was
there but in a latent space, and only after the discovery of the algorithm and its testing the physics became real
(Wigner, 1960).</li>
<li>What is the basis of consciousness? Is general AI possible?</li>
<li>P vs NP problem.</li>
<li>Quantum computer</li>
<li>Global worming</li>
<li>Inner workings of Earth and changing magnetic poles.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<i>Further comments</i>
<br>
Let’s see how we can interpret these unresolved problems. Mind it, some of them are quite mysterious and contradict to
the key principles underpinning our basic intuitive understanding of how the universe must be (e.g. counterintuitive
puzzles in quantum mechanics).
<br><br>
First thing to notice is that any new unexplained phenomena highlights inconsistency of our knowledge - it contradicts
to the established knowledge. Such inconsistencies are integral to science and this is not surprising because
contradictions underpin new discovery - they point to new data that does not fit into existing framework and requires
new explanations. Take these contradictions out and innovations will not be possible. The process of discovering and
resolving contradictions is an ongoing process which never ceases to operate in science. The science without
contradictions is dead.
<br><br>
Second, you may argue that these inconsistencies are happening on the fringes of the main body of knowledge and they are
just transient features called hypothesis. The body of the knowledge itself growth and becomes more and more stable as
new knowledge is discovered and new linkages are established between the network elements. The sceptic, however, may
argue that science picks low-hanging fruits and leaves aside challenges it cannot handle. According to him, science is
successful because it ignores many problems beyond its capacity to solve. Science has made some progress with complex
systems, and stopped when the level of the complexity exceeded its explanatory powers. Science ignores questions
pertaining to metaphysics, afterlife, arts. It solves problems it can solve and ignores all the rest however important
this “rest” could be. The proponents of the successful progression of science dismiss all these accusations as not well
justified and illustrate this point by offering alternative explanations.
<br><br>
Whoever is right, it does not change the fact that at any given time the story told by scientists includes statements
which are not consistent with the main body of its knowledge. This contradiction can be resolved in a number of ways. In
most cases existing theories can be adjusted locally in order to accommodate new facts. If the problem is particularly
hard, it could be set aside, and de facto ignored by the scientific community. You do not want to waste your life on the
problem which has no solution (and no funding). Finally, resolving some contradictions may lead to fundamental, top-down
redesign of the whole system of knowledge. An example of such a revolution provides physics. In early 19th century the
vision of the physics was that of the dead science akin to geography. No new land was left to be discovered.
Analogously, by the 19th century almost all knowledge about the universe has been established (except just a couple
“minor” issues at the fringes of the main body of the knowledge concerning the nature of light and some solid body
irradiance problem) and physic as a science of discovering new knowledge has exhausted itself. For better or worse, we
know that that vision was utterly wrong.
<br><br>
The body of scientific knowledge as a whole is never static but always evolving and reshaping to accommodate new
knowledge into the existing structure. Not all parts of this evolving structure are equally fluid. There are elements
that remain relatively stable and well connected creating a backbone underpinning the whole system. Changing these
elements may cause the collapse of the whole belief network. Such changes almost never happen within the system itself -
there are rules and canons which make sure this never happens. The system must be immune to the self-destruction.
Criticism is allowed but only at a therapeutic level, and only as long as it prevents some unhealthy tendencies which
may threaten the integrity of the whole body. The complete redesign of this body is out of question because this is a
kind of outcomes that the system tends to avoid. You may reshape some secondary appearances and features but do nothing
to undermine the integrity of the whole. The source of the change must reside beyond the body of the teaching, because
it is not about changing some particular theory or a field of the scientific enquiry, but about changing the vision of
the whole world.
<br><br>
It is worth mentioning also that a lot of science is based on rules derived from induction. If we wake up tomorrow and
find the gravity constant changed by say 1%, we will have to accommodate this new observation into out theories
(assuming, of course, that we survive this change). There is nothing in our knowledge that can prevent this from
happening. Rules based on induction can fail anytime.
<br><br>
Finally, I would like to mention Godel’s incompleteness theorems which say there are self-consistent systems in math
such that we cannot prove their consistency within these systems themselves (see Appendix: Godel). While generalising
Godel’s theorems beyond the field of math may not be legitimate, the disquieting suggestion that follows is that the
consistency of our belief networks taken in their totality may not be provable as well. Fortunately, we do not have to
rely on Godel’s theorems to make statements about consistency of our belief networks, because for better or worse these
networks seem to be inherently inconsistent. From this perspective the hypothesis that the math itself might be hanging
on nothingness and may have no solid objective foundations is an interesting and peculiar assumption to entertain but it
has little to do with our affair of establishing criteria to choosing between different inconsistent belief networks.
