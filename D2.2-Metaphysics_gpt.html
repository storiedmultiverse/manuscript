Feel free to skip this chapter if you're familiar with basic philosophy or aren't interested in a brief introduction
based on early philosophy courses. We'll discuss theories about possible worlds and explore why our knowledge is often
uncertain.
<br><br>

This section is mainly based on a philosophy textbook by Loux (2006) and occasionally references other sources, aiming
to show various well-regarded theories about what truly exists.
<br><br>

<h4 id="subtitle1">Metaphysical Realism</h4>
The idea here is simple: there are real things like dogs and cats, and these things exist regardless of what we call
them or want them to be. Plato believed that a dog, as a species, exists as a real and unchanging form in a metaphysical
world of formsâ€”more real than any individual dog we see. He illustrated this with a story about people in a dark cave,
seeing only shadows, which they think are the only real things.
<br><br>
Metaphysical realists believe everything is either a particular (like shadows) or a universal (like the forms casting
the shadows), and both are equally real. Loux describes particulars as unique, temporary entities that don't embody
other things but can change and have physical parts.
<br><br>

Universals, like properties, kinds, and relations, don't take up space and are abstract. They include things like
numbers and concepts, which exist outside of time and space and don't affect or get affected by the physical world.
<br><br>

<h4 id="subtitle2">Nominalism</h4>
Nominalists argue that only specific, individual objects (particulars) exist, and any discussion of universals (like
redness or beauty) is just a complicated way of talking about these objects. They question the reality of abstract
concepts unless they can somehow be linked to real-world objects.
<br><br>
<h4 id="subtitle3">Propositions and Facts, States of Affairs, Events</h4>
We use "propositions" to describe truths about the world, such as "this apple is red," which implies a specific
relationship between the apple and the color red. These propositions are abstract and don't exist in the physical world
but are considered real by metaphysical realists.
<br><br>
<h4 id="subtitle4">Possible Worlds</h4>
The concept of possible worlds helps explain different ways the world could be. It includes not just what is real here
and now but also what could potentially exist or happen. This theory expands our understanding of reality, considering
not only the actual world but also countless other possible scenarios.
<br><br>
<h4 id="subtitle5">Multiverse Theories in Physics</h4>
Physicists' multiverse theories suggest that our universe might be just one of many with different physical laws. These
theories range from simple ideas that there are infinite physical universes to complex notions involving multiple
dimensions and fundamental laws of physics that differ from our own.
