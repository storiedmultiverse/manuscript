This section explores the concept of the "good life," a central theme in many philosophical narratives. We will discuss
how the pursuit of a good life can be a yardstick for evaluating different philosophical views, with truth serving as a
complementary concept. Ethics, which studies moral principles and their justification, will also be briefly discussed.

<h4 id="subtitle1">The Enlightenment Hijack</h4>
Historically, many cultures prioritized well-being over truth until the Enlightenment shifted this focus, elevating
truth as an independent value and linking well-being to scientific progress. This led to significant advances but also
constrained our approach to existential problems, suggesting that our decisions could benefit from integrating quality
of life with truth to address complex modern challenges.
<h4 id="subtitle2">Quality of Life and Well-Being</h4>
"Quality of life" has diverse definitions and is studied across various disciplines, from social sciences to medicine.
Initially linked to material wealth, it has evolved to include personal freedoms and emotional well-being. This section
will focus on the individual's quality of life, examining it through various aspects like biophysical needs, social
norms, and aesthetic values.
<h4 id="subtitle3">Ethics and the Good Life</h4>
While a detailed study of ethics is beyond this text, we will outline its major branches to understand its relevance to
the good life. Ethics helps us navigate right and wrong actions and decide how to live well collectively and
individually.
<h4 id="subtitle4">Deontology</h4>
Deontology argues that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, independent of their outcomes. This theory,
influenced by thinkers like Kant, emphasizes principles or rules to determine moral actions, although it faces
challenges due to its rigidity and the difficulty of applying a single moral principle universally.
<h4 id="subtitle5">Teleology</h4>
Teleology or consequentialism judges actions by their outcomes, aiming for the greatest good for the greatest number.
This approach, which includes utilitarianism, faces challenges in defining what counts as "good" and in predicting the
consequences of actions.
<h4 id="subtitle6">Virtue Ethics</h4>
Virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues rather than specific actions, promoting personal development towards
living a good life. This approach, which can be traced back to Aristotle, suggests that virtuous individuals naturally
act in morally good ways, which can be more adaptive to complex situations than rigid rules.
<h4 id="subtitle7">Meta-Ethics</h4>
Meta-ethics explores the foundations of moral principles: Are they absolute or relative? It examines how moral truths
can be understood and agreed upon, considering both naturalistic and non-naturalistic theories.
In summary, this chapter examines how the pursuit of a good life intersects with ethical theories, suggesting that our
approach to ethics should adapt to include both traditional moral considerations and modern challenges to well-being.
