According to paleontology, the earliest artificial dwellings (made out of bones of mammoths) date back to 15 thousand
years BC (ref to Mikhael Cook). Before then, for many thousands of years people lived in caves. 
The idea of building artificial dwellings for these cavemen may have sounded as ridiculous as today we may
think of the idea of the artificially created worlds. Caves are discovered in the nature rather than made by hand - no
one has questioned this obvious truth. It took thousands of years until the conceptual revolution took place and people
moved from caves to villages.
<br><br>
At the dawn of the 21 century we might be going through the analogous paradigm shift, where inhabitants of different
cultural “caves” come to realise they can create their own worlds tailored to their own needs. There is not one but many
different worlds out there in the nature, and many more could be created artificially when needed. The rest of this
chapter will focus on the development of a conceptual framework (called Storied Multiverse), which i hope, will 
facilitate such paradigm shift.
<br><br>
<h4 id="subtitle1">Resolving contradictions</h4>
People from different cultures believe in different worlds and claim different truth. Stories they tell often contradict
each other. For instance, according to one culture a person post-mortem goes to heavens, according to another culture,
the same person just annihilates. Each of these stories could be more or less coherent by itself, but as soon as we step
outside a particular culture into the multiverse, we have a contradiction between different stories that must be resolved 
(unless, of course, we
take the multiverse to be an abstract placeholder of other stories, which by itself does not have to be meaningful).
<br><br>
From a purely logical perspective any problem can have none, one, or more than one solutions. The first option (i.e. no
solution at all) implies that reconciliation of different storied-worlds within a single multiverse is not
possible. Each individual SW tells a coherent story from the perspective of the inhabitants of that particular world, but
the collection of SWs does not make sense.
<br><br>
Should we care about these contradictions? As long as the inhabitants of individual worlds are happy with their own beliefs,
perhaps, the rest does not matter. As mentioned earlier, we can leave this multiverse to be a placeholder for different
worlds, without requiring the multiverse itself to make sense.
<br><br>
The problem with this account of the multiverse, however, is that, acknowledging and accepting such a sparse structure
of the multiverse where each universe holds its own truth and there is no overarching framework integrating these
stories, breaks communication channels between these worlds and makes social agreement and harmonious coexistence of
different communities difficult if not impossible to achieve. Besides that, such a lazy multiverse, is neither
intellectually nor aesthetically appealing – i think,  it is not worth our time and efforts.
<br><br>
Another way to resolve contradictions between different SWs is by insisting on a single true description of the real
world, all other descriptions ranked with regard to their proximity to that unique truth. Contradictions are resolved
just by downgrading the status of some claims as not being true and assigning a privileged status to other claims
considered to be closer to truth. A certain economy of ontology and efforts follows from this solution because in this
case one needs to take care of only one true description of the universe rather than tracking manifold of SWs. This
solution underpins the paradigm, mainstream vision of the structure of the universe advocated by modern science. It
seems also to appeal to our intuitive understanding of how this world must be organised. For instance, I can make many
predictions of the future, but there is only one real future to be discovered rather than being designed. There is only
one true story which represents one real world. The problem with this account of the universe, however, is that (as we
learnt in previous chapters) unless we deal with simple systems, we may never know truth. Descriptions of complex
systems are irreducibly uncertain and often involve multiple, equally valid interpretations rather than a single true
description.
<br><br>
An alternative to the monoverse vision of the reality provides a multiverse theory which holds that there is not one but
many, quasi-coherent descriptions of the reality (and perhaps there are several corresponding realities) each consistent
with its own set of empirical evidence. This multiverse vision may not appeal to our intuitions (since our intuitions
are based on experiences with simple phenomena) but it is consistent with our understanding of complex systems. It
contradicts to the mainstream vision of the universe, but chimes with the forefront theories in science (i.e. multiverse
theories in physics and possible worlds in philosophy). Further, the fact that we live in multi-culture societies, while
not proving the multiverse vision, does lend further credit to it. One more argument for the multiverse vision, is that
it is more flexible and versatile and, hence, more suitable for managing and maintaining high standards of living as
compared to the monoverse picture.
<br><br>
The multiverse interpretation of the world has its own merits, however, merely postulating this multiverse does not
solve the problem of contradictions. We still have to explain how it is possible that contradictory statements by
different teachings can be simultaneously true in such a multiverse. To achieve this goal, we need a story overarching
individual teachings and resolving contradictions between them.
<br><br>
The strategy<br><br>
First of all, we are not going to develop in this manuscript the only true or the best description of the multiverse. I
believe, such description does not exist. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the way the multiverse can be
designed, and other people can come up with other, not least plausible interpretations of it. This freedom, however,
does not entail anarchy - certain constraints must be introduced to guide such developments and ensure high
quality of the end-product. In our case in particular, these constrains will be referring
to epistemological reasons we have mentioned earlier, such as the requirement of a logically cohesive description of the
multiverse and the existence of reproducible practices delivering features characteristic of it. Besides that, I want
the multiverse to be aesthetically appealing and fulfilling our quality of life requirements. To this end, I shall start
with a fairly general and not particularly polished outline of this multiverse so that we can see it as a whole and
decide later how to evolve it further.
<br><br>
To resolve contradictions between different SWs, we will employ the following strategy. Whenever possible, we will
resolve contradictory statements made by two SWs by allocating objects referred by these statements into separate worlds
and restricting the application domain for each of these statements to the corresponding worlds. For example, to
reconcile statements about the afterlife made by scientist and religious person, we allocate two interpretations of the
afterlife into two distinct storied-worlds one comprising the afterlife of the scientist and another one comprising the
afterlife of the religious person. If for some reasons such localisation of statements is not possible, then we have a
genuine contradiction which must be resolved by altering SWs themselves. For example, we may have two weather forecasts
for tomorrow contradicting each other (rain vs sun). Unless we find means to duplicate the planet Earth and allocate
each copy into a separate world (one with a sunny day and another one with a rainy day), we consider these two forecasts
as expressing a genuine contradiction - one statement must be true and another statement must be false.

<h4 id="subtitle2">Different worlds as different belief networks</h4>
Before we proceed further with the multiverse theory, it makes sense to clarify our vocabulary. Throughout this
manuscript we routinely use such terms as different worlds, many worlds, parallel universes etc. To have a better
understanding of these terms, let me elaborate further on their meaning.
<br><br>
Take the notion of “parallel universes”. In geometry the notion of “parallel” would be interpreted as two (or more)
unbounded surfaces that never cross each other. Anything that happens on one plane is completely independent and
uncorrelated with whatever happens on another plane. If you live on one of these planes you have no idea (and will never
have) of what happens on another plane. If the planes are not perfectly parallel (say they bend and at some places and
may occasionally overlap with each other) then we talk about two worlds which are parallel (and hence independent from
each other) only to a certain degree.
<br><br>
For completely independent and mutually inaccessible worlds (as those predicted by the multiverse physics) there would
be no flux of any property between such worlds which makes them not particularly interesting. For partially coupled
worlds we may have one- or two-way communication channels established between these worlds, implemented via a set of
shared dimensions. For example, in our universe different worlds have shared natural resources. In some other universes
they may have shared feelings, thoughts, existential states etc.
<br><br>
When people talk about parallel universes they often take it as an opportunity to travel from one universe to another
(for example, an alien popping out of the fifth dimension). These parallel universes might have different physics but
whatever difference in cosmology, the personality of the traveller does not change during such transition – the identity
of the traveller remains intact. However exciting, the travel between such parallel universes, conceptually it is not
much different from a conventional travel within a single universe from one place to another.
<br><br>
Let’s take another established term - “many worlds”. If I live in a city and someone lives in a country, does it mean
that we live in different worlds? There are some overlaps and interactions between these two worlds but in general at
some scales and along some dimensions they evolve quite separately from each other. So, do we live in different worlds?
The reader may argue that this example is trivial and not interesting. No one gets excited about such different worlds.
When people talk about different worlds they usually mean something else.
<br><br>
If there are many worlds, they must be different from each other, and that difference must be captured by some
indicators (characteristics) of these worlds. Hence, we have to define the word “world” upfront in order to be able to
claim one world is different from another. We agreed earlier to consider ontology, cosmology, metaphysics,
identity, practices, and values as features identifying a particular world. This list is not unequivocal and can be
altered when needed but, I think, it gives us a sufficiently solid framework to channel our discussion. If two people
have a substantial difference in interpreting these features of the world, we say they are likely to live in different worlds.
<br><br>
This interpretation of different worlds enables us to generalise the notion of the cross-world travel to encompass both
physics and psychology. From this perspective individuals in different cultures live in different worlds. The travel
between worlds now implies not only the space-travel but also changes of personality of the traveller. A migrant
internalising a new culture, for example, is considered a traveller moving from one world to another. 
Changing belief systems through education or new experiences is equivalent to travelling across the worlds. 
Our values, goals, and practices, the whole personality often change as a result of such journey. Such transitions 
are critical to our understanding of our selves and the meaning of our lives. Because it is important 
and interesting, in the rest of this chapter the notion of the cross-word travel will be referring predominantly 
to the changes of personality triggered by the alteration of the internalised belief systems.

<h4 id="subtitle3">Shared dimensions</h4>
Multiverse of fully isolated universes<br><br>
Now that we have a better understanding of the notion of different worlds and the cross-world travel, we can focus on
designing the structure of the multiverse. Remember we expect the multiverse to resolve contradictions between different
worlds comprising it. A trivial solution to this problem is to declare many parallel isolated worlds where for each
statement there is a world where this statement is true. Consider these worlds as streams of parallel and isolated
trajectories. In some of these trajectories the Indian Ocean will stay forever, in others it will dry out in 5000 years.
Whether the statement “the Indian Ocean will stay forever” is true or false depends on whether we live on the trajectory
with the eternal ocean, or the trajectory with the dry ocean.
<br><br>
The problem with such account of the multiverse is that we have no idea to which of these isolated and independent
worlds we belong. Up till now a bunch of these worlds may have exactly the same history and they may start diverging
from each other right now, and some of these worlds will last forever and others will have a finite span. We have no
clue which of these trajectories is ours, and hence this vision does not help us to predict the future. Another problem
with such a multiverse is that we have little freedom in choosing and moving between universes. Even if we new our
current trajectory, we cannot move to another, a better trajectory, because these universes are assumed to be 
fully isolated from each other.
<br><br>
The bottom line is that by introducing a multivese of fully isolated universes we do resolve contradictions but have no
gains compared to the monoverse picture in terms of the predictive powers and the quality of life.
<br><br>
Multiverse of fully coupled universes<br><br>
Now let’s introduce interactions between these worlds. First, assume that all dimensions of all universes are strongly
correlated, so that the fate of every member of the ensemble is about the same as that of the rest. Such multiverse
gives no benefits compared to the conventional monoverse - we still live in a single world with no choice and no
freedom.
<br><br>
Multiverse of partly coupled universes<br><br>
Neither the multiverse of fully correlated SWs nor the multiverse of completely isolated SWs will do the job. To have
the multiverse story epistemologically plausible and interesting enough for us to work with it 
(and may be even live in it) it must be represented by an ensemble of partially coupled worlds. 
A multiverse where certain dimensions are shared across storied-worlds and other dimensions are left isolated and 
private to the communities and individuals inhabiting that multiverse.

<h4 id="subtitle4">Sizmarians</h4>
The multiverse as a collection of worlds with partially shared dimensions seems like the description of our own
world - we have shared natural resources, partially binding social constructs and a diverse range of metaphysical
beliefs each advocating a particular vision of transcendental realms. 
So, perhaps, we already live in such a storied multiverse.

<br><br>
According to the ISO machinery, for this multiverse to be real it must have a logically cohesive description, including
an outline of features characteristic of it and practices delivering these features. It is up to us to decide how much
of this logical cohesion we want this description to have (how much is enough for us to believe it is true). We may push
it hard towards reconciling all established belief systems, or we can leave these systems slack, as they are - there 
will be some cross-world inconsistencies present in such multiverse and so what? We can live with this as long as 
the inhabitants of individual worlds comprising this multiverse can live with each other. 
They may believe different truths, but as Richard Rorty pointed out, the truth may not be particularly relevant 
point to care about when it comes to the peaceful coexistence of heterogeneous communities. 
And yet, having acknowledged that a conceptual rigor of the multiverse theory may not be of a paramount 
significance to our lives, it would be nice to have at least major
contradictions in this multiverse brushed away, so that we can believe it is real. 
Apart from being intellectually appealing, such reconciled multiverse may provide common grounds for individual 
worlds to help inhabitants of these worlds to discuss issues when needed.

<br><br>
In what follows, I shall stick with the ISO machinery, to define the ontology, cosmology and the
metaphysics of the storied-multiverse. According to this vision, the storied-multiverse has been created 
(or will be created) by people who
instantiate and maintain it through practices. There are 2 ways they can accomplish this task. 
First, the 
inhabitants of individual worlds can create a multiverse unintentionally, as a byproduct of their isolated efforts
aiming at their own individual worlds. For example, Ann instantiates the world A, Bill instantiates the world B. 
By definition A and B make up the multiverse AB, but neither Ann nor Bill intended to create a multiverse.
Each of them care only about their own world.  
The collection AB might be representing a multiverse but no one believes it is real - Ann believes only A is true, 
Bill believes only B us true. Since no one knows about this multiverse, according to ISO machinery,
it is not really real - it exists in an abstract hypothetical state (which is, it may or may not be real). For example, 
Ann and Bill may live in a monoverse where only one belief system (A) is true, all other beliefs (B, C, D ...) 
are false. 

Another way to create a multiverse is by purposefully instantiating it out of the hypothetical state. 
To accomplish this task, we need a community of practitioners - call them sizmarians 
(after the Georgian word sizmari – dream) - who 
believe storied-multiverse is real and can design, instantiate, and maintain it through practices.  
Like many other inhabitants of the multiverse, sizmarians inhabit their own
world Sizmari, which is part of the storied multiverse. Unlike many other
inhabitants of the multiverse who believe only their own worlds are real, sizmarians think there are many different
all equally real worlds.

<br><br>
Sizmarians practice the ISO machinery on a daily basis and take full responsibility for instantiating and 
maintaining a storied-multiverse overarching individual worlds and explaining them through the ISO machinery. 
They believe every world in this multiverse has been created and is maintained by people. 
Without people gods and the universe transform into an abstract hypothetical state. 


<br><br>
Like many other belief systems, the storied-world of Sizmarians promises a sustainable well-being for its inhabitants. 
Peculiar to
sizmarians is a wide range of options available to them to achieve such well-being. They can design and instantiate new
personalities, new social orders and new gods. Furthermore, if needed they can create fundamentally new complex entities
by integrating novel theories and practices and delivering new experiences never seen or experienced before. There are 
almost no limits to what they can design and instantiate through the ISO machinery.
<br><br>


<br><br>
<h4 id="subtitle5">Afterlife</h4>

Sizmarians design and instantiate almost literally everything in the universe, including their own afterlife. They
believe there are many afterlives already established by various cultures and teachings, and many more will be 
established in the future. 

<br><br>
Let’s see how this project of instantiating an afterlife can be accomplished through the ISO machinery. 
According to this schema, an infinite number of afterlives
exists in a hypothetical state, and some of them can be instantiated via practices. To be specific
let's assume we are going to instantiate a hypothesis that there is a paradise on another planet, far away in 
the galaxy. To avoid contradictions, we suggest we can never reach this place by conventional
means (e.g. by space-ship). The only way to get there is by passing away, and only certain people can get there. To
instantiate this paradise, we need a plausible description of it and practices delivering features
characteristic of it.
<br><br>
Let’s start with the description. We will assume there is no death, no thickness, and no pain on that planet. 
(Yeh..., i know, it is not particularly original or novel, but lets stick with it for a time being). 
Everybody is always young and healthy. There is no sadness and no suffering. 
The climate and environment on this planet are pretty much the same as those on the
planet Earth. People we love wait for us there so that we can enjoy this paradise together. <br>
Sizmarians tend to call this planet a hub-paradise because they do not stay there forever. 
They enjoy experiences  and appreciate new capacities 
such as flying in clouds, making bubbles out of nebulas and playing cricket with stars - 
almost everything is possible in this paradise, except that you cannot escape the boredom. At some
point in time sizmarians get bored and move elsewhere to other places, where they can meet 
challenges and release the beauty and the power hidden deep inside and making it across the transcendental 
divide collapsing the wild infinity into a single point.
<br><br>
This snippet illustrates the point but by no means it provides a proper description of this paradise. 
To underpin the storied-world, the decsription has to be rich and convincing. Perhaps, something analogous to those
fiction worlds which are so extensive and comprehensive you start wondering whether they have been invented or
indeed exist somewhere out there in the parallel realm.
<br><br>
Another critical piece of the ISO machinery (missed so far in our description of the paradise) is practice. 
There are many different stories and many different novels,
some of them describing comprehensive fictional worlds, but all these stories are just bits of information, dead stuff, 
unless they include specific instructions telling us how to instantiate them. 
“Practice” is the key word that differentiates abstract philosophical theories and novels from science 
and religious systems. Through practices we create empirical evidence that turns a
theoretical construct into the real stuff. The question is what we take to be an empirical evidence of the paradise 
and how we are going to instantiate it? In other words, we need to know features characteristic of the paradise and 
practices recovering these features. 

<br><br>
Let's start with features. Remember whenever we build an artificial construct we have some purpose in mind. 
The construct is meant to function properly and deliver specific outcomes.
According to the ISO machinery, as long as these outcomes are delivered, whatever the description of that construct,
it must be referring to the real stuff. If the lawn mower cuts the grass, it is the real lawn-mower 
however we describe it. 

<br><br>
So, what is the key function of the paradise? In other words, what do we expect this paradise to deliver? <br>
The first thing which comes to my mind is that it is a placeholder for people passed away. 
It is meant to accommodate gone people. Kind of an island where all these people go (but no one
comes back to tell us this island is indeed real). Can we go there ourselves and prove it real by seeing it,
touching it, listening to it, and, perhaps, even smelling it? If we were able to do so, we would definitely prove 
this island real.

<br><br>
The short answer is we cannot. Well ..., in principle, we can check it when we die but until then we cannot.
<br><br>
Does it mean we cannot prove the afterlife? And if we cannot, shall we abandon our project? 
<br><br>
I think, we shall pause here for a moment and 
think what this paradise means for us, and why we need it. 
Is this analogy with an island good enough for us to rely on it? Do we value this paradise 
because it represents a specific place, a particular environment with mountains, oceans, and valleys, 
or there is something else in this paradise, which is really valuable to us, something defining its essence? 

<br><br>
I would argue, it is not so much a place or an environment that we value in this paradise, but a particular 
state of being associated with it. We expect this paradise to provide us with a positive state of being 
characterized with no fear, no anxiety, no stress, but light, warmth, energy. And we don't really care about the 
oceans, mountains, and vegetation on this planet as long as we can attain this special state of being. 
This state is a feature characteristic of our paradise, and having this state delivered 
through reproducible practices, according to the ISO machinery, would prove this paradise real. 

<br><br>
So far so good. We have a description of the paradise, we identified a feature characteristic of it, and 
there might be practices delivering this feature to this-worldly people. In other world, we might be able to prove 
this paradise is real for us (alive people).

<br><br>
Ok. I'm happy for alive people being able from time to time to live as if they are in paradise. 
They think they are having glimpses of paradise through this experience.  
What about people who already passed away? Can we prove this paradise in the afterlife works for them too? 

<br><br>
We already know we cannot go there and test it ourselves. The question that follows is, does it make sense 
for us to suggest that this special state of being, called paradise, holds in the afterlife too? 

<br><br>
I think, the right answer to this question is - it depends. Something that makes little or no sense in one context 
may have a perfect sense in another context. Let me explain this point. 

<br><br>
The transition to afterlife happens once in a life time and is analogous to many other unique events 
(like a particular wedding ceremony, for example). To prove the wedding ceremony real, we collect present day
data and link them to the wedding event through the chain of logical inferences.
These data may encompass our memories of the wedding (important to us but not particularly convincing 
piece of evidence for others), observations of the family members, photographs taken during 
the ceremony etc. All this data is available to us at present. When integrated into a logically cohesive 
story about the wedding ceremony these data prove 
this ceremony real (it is not something we hallucinated about, or invented like a fiction story). 
Since we can link unequivocally present observational data to the past event, this data is considered 
empirical evidence of that event - we don't have to invent time-machine to go back in time and witness this 
wedding ceremony again in order to prove it real.

<br><br>
Analogously, for the paradise, if we can link an immediate and mediated experiences of the paradise (such as 
our personal experience of a particular state of being associated with the paradise, 
and also observations of social events and material artefacts associated with this paradise), 
if we can link these present-day data with the description of the future event or phenomena (ie afterlife paradise),
then we would take these data as an empirical evidence of this future event or phenomena. In other words, if we 
can tell a logically-cohesive story integrating our present-day experiences and observations 
with the description of the afterlife paradise, then these data would be considered evidence to prove this paradise
real. Would they?

<br><br>
It feels like something is not quite right here. Unlike the wedding ceremony 
where all data points almost unequivocally to the very specific event in the past, 
with the afterlife stories different people can provide different interpretations of the 
same set of observations, telling us different, often contradicting each other stories. 
(well ... to be fair, past events can be as much uncertain as the future events, but we still 
tend to think of them as particular events which have happened in the past rather than a range 
of possibilities we may or may not encounter in the future).
The problem seems to be a random, indeterminate nature of the future - we can tell 
many different stories about the future and all these stories may look plausible. 
How do we know which one is true? 
<br><br>

Aha! Finally, we have reached the roots of this problem and can show that 
the right answer to this question depends on the context. 

<br><br>
From the monoverse perspective (advocating single truth), there is one future and there 
must be one true story describing this future. Given limited evidence we have about the afterlife, 
it might be difficult if not impossible to select this story out of the infinite number of possibilities. 
Subsequently, whatever story we select, it will have little credibility. 
Imagine a bag with billions of white marbles and only one marble black. The chances of randomly selecting 
the black one are close to zero. 
 
<br><br>
On the other hand, from the multiverse perspective, it makes perfect sense to have many different 
stories simultaneously true, describing many different futures. According to this vision,
whatever is created in this multiverse, is created through the ISO machinery which applies across the worlds 
to every domain including the afterlife. Hence, the afterlife is designed and instantiated by people through 
the ISO machinery analogous to any other entity they design and instantiate in this world. Instead of a single 
colored marble in the bag, now we have vast majority of balls painted, and our chances of selecting the colored marble are 
much higher. Furthermore, if by chance we picked up a white ball, we can paint it in any color we wish.<br> 

<br><br>
Another point to make here is that according to monoverse vision, there is a fundamental difference between the past
and the future events, in a sense that past has already being instantiated and exists as a single particular entity 
while the future exists as a range of hypothetical states. Strategies applied to prove a particular event in the past 
may not be applicable to the future hypothetical states which may or may not instantiate.

<br><br>
On the other hand, from the multiverse perspective, there is no fundamental difference between the past and the 
future events. Both can exist in a hypothetical and particular states. Strategies tested with the past events, can be
transferred and applied directly to the future events.

<br><br>
These considerations, of course, does not prove the sizmarian-paradise unequivocally but they do lend 
a strong credit to it - within the multiverse context it makes sense for us to suggest this paradise is real, 
even though there is little hard evidence of it available at the present. Note that none of the alternative 
hypotheses have a strong observational support either.

<br><br>
Taking an island, again, as an analogy, from a monoverse perspective there could be only one island 
in the ocean (or none) and all people eventually go there regardless what they do or what they wish. 
From the multiverse perspective there are many, perhaps, even infinite number of islands, and depending on
the ship we build and the direction we take to navigate, we arrive at one or another location in the afterlife.
Given the infinite number of islands in this ocean, many of them already instantiated, one more island 
(sizmarian-paradise) does not spoil the picture - it makes sense to suggest such an island either already 
exists or can be created in the future if needed. It would be much more difficult to accommodate this island 
into the monoverse picture.

<br><br>
A point worth making here is that when dealing with highly uncertain phenomena,
the standards of proofs must be adjusted properly. We don't have and cannot have strong evidence to discriminate 
between hypotheses concerning metaphysical domains. Yet, when it comes to afterlife, we cannot suspend questions in 
the thin air by leaving them unanswered. Whether we like it or not, we internalize and believe one out of many 
possible hypotheses, however little evidence it may have. The choice is guided by a number of 
reasons including our general understanding of ourselves and the world around us. 
Having a story consistent with a more general belief system, in this case, is considered sufficient reason 
for us to believe it plausible (or even true). Apart from epistemological reasons, other factors influencing 
our decisions when dealing with such irreducibly uncertain problems are our psychological and aesthetic preferences. 
The notion of the sustainable well-being becomes instrumental to the ultimate choice when dealing with such problems. 

<br><br>
We can grant sizmarians to have this paradise by default - there are practices specific to sizmarians, and as long as 
the state of the sizmarian being is attained through these practices, we assume this is equivalent to being in the 
state of the paradise. On the other hand, if you think this is not enough and sizmarians must earn it, 
we can add some practices to reinforce this connection. For example, analogous to established religious teachings,
defining paradise as a state or place accessible only by virtuous people, we can require sizmarian-paradise 
to be instantiated through the ordered sequence of life events, experiences, thoughts, sentiments. 
When you act according to virtues, you feel as if you are in paradise, so, perhaps, this is the 
paradise state of being.<br>

<br><br>
Huh, looks like we are getting somewhere. We have outlined a strategy to create a new paradise, 
such that both the strategy and the paradise make sense in the multiverse context. In other words, 
if one believes storied-multiverse, then it takes only a minor effort for him/her to believe the sizmarian-paradise.  
Isn’t it cool?  
<br>
You are still not convinced? … 
<br>
But you should be, because the reason for your doubts is not
realising the right context for this discussion, which is a contingent nature of our beliefs. Whatever your
belief about the afterlife is right now, and whatever other teachings you may think about, 
they got the same issue as the afterlife we have just invented – 
they are all missing hard empirical evidence. Reiterating again Richard Rorty, when we talk about the
afterlife, we shall leave aside the notion of truth as not being particularly useful and focus instead on our well-being. 
The notion of truth in these circumstances is too vague and unreliable to guide our decisions. 
<br>
Since we don't know truth, you may think, we shall suspend the problem
and refuse to make a choice, but we cannot. Whether we like it or not, we still internalise one or another 
interpretation of the afterlife and the choice is often contingent, depending on
our upbringing, education, individual preferences hardwired through the genetic build up, etc. 
Given these considerations, it makes sense for us to choose the interpretation of the afterlife we 
feel comfortable with rather than the one which is "true".

<br><br>
If the distant planet as a placeholder for a paradise is too hard for you to visualise and instantiate, 
an alternative course of actions is to create an
afterlife on the planet Earth (e.g. species of reincarnation). This opens an opportunity for various sorts of practices
we may find easier to relate to the afterlife (e.g. you can visit places and collect
data about the future rebirth environments, including culture, particular country, place, and perhaps even details 
about specific family you anticipate to be born again in the future).

<br><br>
In case you are still not convinced and wonder whether we make the afterlife really real through such practices, I
think, this is not a particularly good question to ask, because the definition of the real is something that we invent
ourselves.

<br><br>
You still wonder if it makes sense at all to believe in this? I think, given all our knowledge about
the world and ourselves, it makes sense to believe in the afterlife. Furthermore, to my mind, rather than
asking of whether the paradise is real or not, a better question to ask is what is better to believe, the existential
nothing or the paradise? Do we want our kids to grow with no hope for afterlife, or we better give them such an
opportunity?


<h4 id="subtitle6">Existential trap of nothing</h4>
When the first excitement about the multiverse is gone, and the dust settles, you may start to feel deep-down
inside some unsettling and unnerving feeling that something important is missing, that something is not quite right
about this theory, particularly when we talk about people inhabiting this multiverse. The problem comes from the
acknowledgement of the fact that any particular SW in our multiverse theory is finite, in a sense that we can always go
beyond it. We have a capacity to transcend a particular storied world and step outside it. Whatever SW we find in that
transcended realm, this new realm can in turn be transcended and abandoned, because it is also just one more story in
the infinite collection of stories. There are trap-worlds in this journey of the cross-world migration - the worlds
declaring their absolute right on a single, their own truth which does not acknowledge the existence of other
worlds. Once you get there, you are stuck and in general cannot escape from it - the multiverse does not exist for you
anymore. However, if you are able somehow, to sneak in some stories about the multiverse or keep some core elements, the
acknowledgement of the multiverse, perhaps through some irony and scepticism hidden deep down, inside your heart, then
you may have chances to get out of that trap.
<br><br>
The worst trap you may run into during such journey is the world of the existential nothing. You may hop from one
storied world to another many times but eventually you will end up into the world of nothing – the world, which is
beyond any story and any language. And once you get there, you will have all the angst and nausea peculiar to
existentialism. Our multiverse, by the mere fact that we represent it a kind of a collection of compartments which need
to be placed somewhere, is suspended in nothingness which encompasses the multiverse of stories and is an integral and
irreducible part of it. Another interpretation of nothing is that of a null, which is present in any world and where we
can occasionally slip in. Either way, the challenge we face is that of making sense out of this empty, cold, dark and
meaningless world of nothing.
<br><br>
It is not a coincidence that one of the key proponents of the epistemological relativism encouraging our developments,
Richard Rorty, took seriously existentialism and was particularly attracted to the line of thought and interpretations
by Heidegger, one of the founding fathers of existentialism. The multiverse theory and existentialism both share the
same problem of nothingness. Can you move beyond that nothing into another storied world? It is not obvious you can,
because in order to make such a move, you will have to have intentions, desires, hope, will, or something like that, but
there is nothing in the world of existentialism to provide you with such resources. All other worlds, you may have
believed so far, according to Sartre, are just examples of “bad faith” (ref …). You must abandon any hope and face harsh
reality - the meaningless world where nothing has purpose and nothing has value.
<br><br>
I believe, most people have had that experience of nothingness when they were sucked into abyss by some random
misfortune or a bad weather. But every time they get there, most people are able to get out because they are attached
to their stories and practices that push them to the surface. 
Perhaps, we can write up such stories for sizmarians, but they may
not be solid enough to pool them out because nothing in the multiverse is immune to doubts, and sizmarians are known to
be suspicious about some random stories – they always seek for hard practical evidence to prove such stories true.
<br><br>
Note also that the world of nothing within the body of our multivers theory is a contradiction, because there is no
story in nothing, but just only an object. In object-oriented programming there are abstract classes which never
instantiate. In the world of nothing the reverse is true - we have an object, a being, with no underpinning class
(story). We have a hint here that there could be something preceding a story, something beyond the language, clean and
pure being - nothing. The fact that this existential nothing is filled with angst and fear could be attributed to a bad
luck. If it were Buddhists instead of the western Europeans to intuit that existential nothing first, then, perhaps,
instead of the angst and fear we would associate it with a pure joy or nirvana.
<br><br>
Anyway, the way existentialists resolved this impasse was by postulating a hero, a man who can step up, and create the
ground in a vacuum, the ground to support himself and others. He is a hero because he takes responsibility and he
himself is the first and the ultimate cause and reason for his actions. He is the guy who instantiates out of the
nothing the meaning and the purpose of our lives in this meaningless world. So, in a way, the thesis of the absolute
nothingness is an exaggeration. The absolute nothing means death and no alive people. As long as we are alive, there is
meaning, and it does not reside outside, in the external world, but inside us. We as leaving beings can postulate and
instantiate it. We always have it inside, and, hence, we are never alone in the world of nothing. Nothing does not
really exist because we exist.
<br><br>
I think, we need such a hero in our multiverse too. Or perhaps, if you are tired of heroes or do not feel like having
the whole world on your shoulders, then some other stuff we can hang on. And that something must reside beyond the
language, because the world of nothing dissolves all words, strips out all the meaning they may have, and leaves behind
just an angst and nausea (well, at least, according to existentialists).
<br><br>
Do we know an entity which resides beyond the language and yet is still capable of supporting us? Remember that one of
the reasons for building a multiverse was to achieve a sustainable well-being for the inhabitants of that multiverse.
The question that follows is if the well-being is so important for us, shall we leave it on the mercy of 
some contingent
factors we often cannot control of we better define it as a prior self-sufficient entity which either permeates the
whole multiverse or resides within a human being. The well-being which is always there, constant and independent of any
circumstances so that we can always rely on it when needed. Let’s introduce such a prior and sustainable well-being.

<h4 id="subtitle7">A prior goodness</h4>
In recent years physicists introduced dark matter and dark energy to their theories of the universe to explain the
rotation of galaxies. No one ever seen these dark matter and dark energy, and no one knows exactly what they are but
having them postulated reconciles observations with theory (i.e. equations of physics). Otherwise this theory 
just don’t make sense.
<br><br>
Perhaps, analogously we need to introduce a prior-goodness or a prior well-being, so that we can keep going in this
weird world full of pain and suffering and very little meaning (if any) attached to our lives by nature. Imagine a
five-dimensional universe where one dimension is for time, three dimensions are for space and one more extra dimension
is allocated for a beauty or a goodness. This goodness permeates the whole world at any distance and for any time. It
always exists regardless circumstances and underpins our capacity for a prior sustainable well-being. Just think about
it – <br>
A PRIOR SUSTAINABLE WELL-BEING. 
<br>
The well-being which lasts forever. However bleak and miserable your life, there is always light and hope, you 
only need to see it.

<br><br>
Such a prior sustainable will-being must be a game changer. It makes all our theories about afterlife, 
before life, meaning
of life, etcetera, pretty much surplus. Blah-blah-blah - all these words do not matter in a state of a prior sustainable
well-being. Whatever was driving us to build these theories, whether it was a stick or a carrot or both, it does not
matter anymore because, having this state of the prior sustainable well-being established, gets us to the destination
point immediately bypassing all intermediate steps.
<br><br>
Sizmarians, of course, would love this challenge – designing and instantiating such a prior well-being or a prior
goodness. The goodness which may have never existed earlier but becomes the most salient feature of the universe as soon
as instantiated out of nothing.
<br><br>
Now, before we go any further, let’s clarify whether such well-being is possible at all. Does it make sense to talk
about a prior well-being in the world of tragedy and sorrow? <br>
I think it does, for such simple reason that we know people who live in this state of a prior well-being. People who
never fail to hope for a better future and have the courage to stand for the right course despite everything being
against it. People who have wisdom and sense of the justice. People who love and care and can lead by example. I
believe, also kids can feel this prior goodness, and because of that goodness they belong to the paradise and 
radiate love.
<br><br>
A prior sustainable well-being is clearly not happiness but must be instrumental to it. It is likely to be associated
with the notion of a good life, but it is not a good life because the life cannot be good a priory. It is a state of a
being which is always present, like another dimension, a low frequency signal, modulating all our thoughts, feelings,
actions. Not everyone can perceive it, but those who do, live in a different world.
<br><br>
Now, to make it clear, by no means this prior well-being, which is independent of the external circumstances, by no
means it makes people ignorant to the suffering of others or makes them immune to experiencing such feelings by themselves.
The pain, the sorrow, the sadness still exist in their lives. The only difference introduced by the prior well-being is
a capacity for such people to always perceive a prior goodness.
<br><br>


<h4 id="subtitle7">Virtue practice</h4>

A feature characteristic of the storied-multiverse is either a prior sustainable well-being 
(a particulatr state of being attributed to sizmarions) or more generally it is a good life.
This well-being and good life are the main reasons driving the development of the storied-multiverse. 
The key functions we expect from it. 

Once the shape and the taste of the cookie is known, we need to know a recipe to cook it. We need to know practices
instantiating either a prior goodness or a good life. The notion of the good life is closely associated the notion of virtues.
Hence, virtures are prime candidates for practices underpinning good life or a prior well-being.
In Other words, the storied world is to be instantiated via sizmarian practocing virtures.


The range of options is wide open. Any practices
where we seek perfection and through that perfection create goodness would fit the bill. 
Art, science, business, hobby, life in general –
almost any activity has practices which are intrinsically good, which make sense doing for the sake of these practices
themselves rather than as means for achieving some other goals. By enacting such practices, sizmarians
instantiate a prior goodness.

Another option is taking care of your self through the self improvement.
To facilitate this process, sizmarians have designed a virtue gym where
they attend to different dimensions of their personality by cultivating specific groups
of virtues. The strategy is consistent with
the ISO machinery - provide a general description of yourself
and then instantiate characteristic features through practices. For example, they can define a person in terms of his
or her bio-physical, psychological, intellectual, social, spiritual, and transcendental dimensions. 
If needed, can add some extra features, such as for example external factors (natural, financial, political, etc) 
or factors instrumental to our personality but generally beyond our reach (Genger, age, ethnicity).
The line between improving a personality and creating a new person is slim. Furthermore, sizmarians believe
creating a new person is equivalent to creating the whole new world. So, perhaps, i should have called a virtue
gym a storied-multiverse laboratory.

<br><br>
We have just scratched the surface, and much more can be said about the prior goodness and the corresponding practices.
Analogously we could have introduced and tell stories about a prior beauty. I’ll leave it to others more capable than
I’m to progress it further. I believe also such theories must be accompanied by practices which can open for us new
directions hard to perceive from a purely theoretical perspective. Until such practices are established and implemented,
I think, a purely theoretical exploration of the notion of prior goodness could be either postponed or focused
on the study of historical records.


<h4 id="subtitle8">Character types</h4>
<i>The Householder</i> <br><br>
They are inhabitants of the SW worlds. They have beliefs and they live in these beliefs. They need everything to be
clean, ordered and ensured. Their belief must be solid, reliable, and comfortable. They are happy to move from one
universe to another if needed, but they hate existential vacuum and nothingness of the transition. They can refine,
adjust, improve, make it better and even much better. They can break some parts and rebuild it, but they never break the
whole structure, and they never start from scratch. They are good in maintaining established order. They are happy with
what they have and do not approve revolutions. They are reliable, solid and happy. They enjoy their lives, and when time
comes pass away into another realm, and continue to live happily ever after. They have achieved the goal, a sustainable
well-being. They may not have experienced a bliss which lasts for a second and comprises eternity, they may not be aware
of this dimension at all, they have heard about it, but they do not care and live it to crazy artists.

<br><br>
<i>The Renouncer (nomad) </i> <br><br>
He is an artist, a joker, a man who lives in a split of a second. He does not care about our cosy, comfortable worlds.
He does not care about eternity. He lives in the world where every second is filled with an infinity. It is a transient
stuff, a flower, a bliss, a genius that matter to him. He is destructive, he is explosive, he is a renouncer. He denies
these clumsy worlds and structures. He laughs out and makes fun out of those dead serious householders hanging
to their structures, and scared to death of anything new and unrestrained. 
<br><br>

<i>Others</i> <br><br>
There are also others neither renouncers nor householders in this multiverse, but I don’t quite know and understand
them yet.

<br><br>
<SUMMARY>
To summarise, in the previous chapter we introduced an ontology, cosmology and metaphysics of the storied multiverse
via the ISO machinery. We said there are domains of an abstract and particular items, and there is a cycling of the material 
across these domains maintained by human beings via ISO machinery.
<br><br>
In this chapter, we introduced sizmarians - the inhabitants of the multiverse, which instantiate and maintain 
this multiverse via practices.
A prior sustainable well being of the sizmarians (or a good life) is considered a feature
characteristic of this storied multiverse. In other words, the main function of the multiverse 
(the key reason we have created it) is a prior sustainable well-being of the inhabitants 
of the multiverse (or good life). Virtues define practices instrumental to such a prior well-being (good life).
