        What do you think about having not one, the only real and true universe out there in the nature, but instead having
        many different real worlds comprising together an entity called a multiverse? However exciting this proposition may
        sound, the idea itself is definitely not new - it goes back to at least the time of the early Buddhism advocating the
        existence of many different planes of reality. Nowadays the idea of the multiverse has got further traction through the
        multiverse theories in physics and possible world theories in philosophy. A typical feature of modern talks about the
        multiverse is that individual universes comprising a multiverse are spatio-temporally isolated from each other. In other
        words, we have no access to these worlds - we can think them but cannot observe them and cannot feel them. Because of
        such an isolated nature of these worlds, their existence hardly matters to our lives.
        <br><br>
        
        The multiverse, sketched in this document is of a different kind. It is a multiverse where people can travel
        from one world to another. Furthermore, in this multiverse they can create their own worlds, custom made and tailored to
        their own needs. I dub it a “Storied Multiverse” (SM or StorMul).
        
        <br><br>
        For a Storied Multiverse to make sense, it must be based on a more or less coherent theory consistent with the
        established knowledge of science and our day-to-day practices. This theory does not have to be perfect but it must be
        plausible enough to be compatible with other rival theories (note, none of these theories, including different versions
        of monoverse, is perfect either). The requirement of the coherence and consistency may not be trivial to satisfy. So the
        first question we will be asking is about the logical possibility of this project. Does it makes sense at all to suggest
        that there is not one but many different worlds? Once we have an affirmative answer to this question, we will engage
        further on the next project of developing a prototype of this theory. To facilitate these developments, I am offering
        here an outline of what might be considered an early and incomplete draft of such theory.
        
        <br><br>
        Why bother with a multiverse theory? It is fun - a journey into the unknown full of exciting discoveries. 
        Besides that, such multiverse may facilitate a meaningful communication between isolated communities claiming
        exclusive rights to truth and denying such rights to others.
