        What do you think about a multiverse - a collection of many different worlds comprising 
        together the realm of the "reality" (whatever we may call by this name). The multiverse as an environment, place where we all 
        live sometimes not even realising it? 
        <br>
        Sounds a bit vague and imprecise but at the same time exciting and kind of promising, isn't it?  
        It is. However, the idea of the multiverse itself definitely is not new - it goes back at 
        least to the time of the early Buddhism advocating the
        existence of many different planes of the reality. Nowadays the idea of the multiverse has got further traction through the
        multiverse theories in physics and possible world theories in philosophy. A typical feature of modern talks about the
        multiverse is that individual universes comprising a multiverse are spatio-temporally isolated from each other. In other
        words, we have no access to these worlds - we can think about them but can neither observe nor feel them. Because of
        such an isolated nature of these worlds, their existence hardly matters to our daily lives.
        <br><br>
        
        The multiverse, sketched in this document is of a different kind. It is a multiverse where people can travel
        from one world to another. Furthermore, in this multiverse they can create their own worlds, custom made and tailored to
        their own needs. I dub it a “Storied Multiverse” (SM or StorMul).
        
        <br><br>
        For a Storied Multiverse to make sense, it must be based on a more or less coherent theory consistent with the
        established knowledge of science and our day-to-day practices. This theory does not have to be perfect but it must be
        plausible enough to be compatible with other rival theories (note, none of these theories, including different versions
        of monoverse, is perfect either). The requirement of the coherence and consistency may not be trivial to satisfy. So the
        first question we will be asking is about the logical possibility of this project. Does it makes sense at all to suggest
        that there is not one but many different worlds? Once we have cleared this roadblock, we will engage
        further on the next project of developing a prototype of this theory. 
        
        <br><br>
        Why bother with a multiverse theory? It is fun - a journey into the unknown. 
        Besides that, I think, such multiverse may facilitate a meaningful communication between isolated communities 
        claiming exclusive rights to truth and denying such rights to others.
