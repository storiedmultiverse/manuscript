<h1>1.1 SW Definition</h1>
<h3>The alien</h3>
Far away in the galaxy live aliens who believe in a multiverse. They believe there is an infinite number of worlds in
the multiverse and they live in one of those. These aliens can teleport themselves to any place in the galaxy within a
few seconds. Everything is fine with such teleportation except the uncertainty principle - as the distance they teleport
increases, so does the uncertainty of the destination place. In other words, they do not know exactly which one out of
the many possible worlds of the multiverse they will land on. On the other hand, without such knowledge they cannot plan
their trip back home. Once teleported, they need to know exactly the description of the world they have landed on.
<br><br>
One of these aliens has teleported himself, perhaps by an accident, to the planet Earth - far away from his home planet.
His first course of action on Earth, is to establish his new positioning – the description of this world. He collects
information about this planet and its inhabitants. He reads books, watches movies, talks to people. These people tell
him different stories about their world and these stories often contradict each other. The scientist tells him about
particles and the void and the physical machinery of the universe, the priest talks about the divine and angels, and the
general says nothing matters except friendship, honour and duty. Kids suggest to the alien to write a letter to Santa –
he may help him to get back home.
<br><br>
The alien, therefore, has to ascertain which of these descriptions is the most accurate. First he is going to separate
facts from fiction and then make a decision as to which viewpoint he believes to be true. He knows there is a common
knowledge shared among the majority of the communities, basic things such as not crossing the road when the light is
red, washing your hands before lunch, if you drop something it will fall and so on. But there are also discrepancies in
these stories which make them inconsistent with each other. Some of these inconsistencies could be resolved by assuming
these stories to be complementary to each other and referring to different aspects of the same world. For instance, the
story of the general would fit both the world of the scientist and the world of the priest. But the story of the
scientist and the story of the priest are hardly complementary to each other and their reconciliation is not a
straightforward task. One of the key points of the controversy here is, for example, the concept of human life. Both
science and religion claim their exclusive authority and the rights to explain and manage this complex entity. Both give
drastically different accounts of the human being starting from the very definition, to its origins and its purpose.
<br><br>
Our alien is open minded and if needed can accept and believe exotic realities, including worlds inhabited by fairies
and Santa Claus. He knows, however, some of these stories may not refer to literal worlds. To separate truth from the
counterfeit, he tests them through a number of check points such as, for example:
<ol>
<li>The requirement of the self-consistent description of the world – the real world must be based on a more-or-less
coherent story. Neither of stories he has heard so far has been perfect, and each included a degree of inconsistency but
some of them were more coherent than others. </li>

<li>Secondly, he tests these descriptions against empirical evidence, something that he can observe, measure and know
with a high degree of confidence. If a story says “there is an apple on the tree” but he cannot see it, then the story
is likely to be false.</li>

<li>Thirdly, he has a time machine which accelerates time. Instead of spending ages practicing, for example, Buddhism, he
can test enlightenment in a matter of just a few hours.</li>

<br><br>
If neither of these check-points provides conclusive answers, he subjects the story to further, less objective but still
useful tests, such as:
<br><br>

<li>Credibility of the source - a story told by a liar is unlikely to be true.</li>
<li>Persistence through time also matters – a story and practices backed by historical records would be more believable
than a recent invention.</li>
<li>Finally, he would put more trust in a story which is told and believed by a large community rather than that of a
small group of practitioners.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
Ideally, he would seek black and white answers which clearly state false and true descriptions of the world. However,
having some experience of the multiverse travel, he realises that instead of having clear cut line separating the true
worlds from fairy tales he may end up with different degrees of plausibility. Yet, he hopes that there will be one story
which stands out and has a much higher probability to be true than all others. He could then utilize this description to
establish his current positioning in the multiverse with enough accuracy to navigate back home.
<br><br>
The point I advocate in this and the following chapter is that, apart from some trivial cases, our alien will not be
able to figure out which of these stories is true. Neither of the aforementioned check points, designed to filter out a
single truth, is capable of fulfilling this task. The first check point, for example, fails because each description
tells a more or less coherent story but none of these stories is fully coherent, they all have some inconsistencies and
imperfections. As for the correspondence to empirical ¬evidence, the choice of the evidence is not unique and depends on
what people believe and what they practice. In other words, there are many different descriptions of the world, each of
these descriptions tells more-or-less coherent story and each of these descriptions is consistent with its own set of
empirical evidence. Experiments with a time machine show that individuals internalise beliefs and convictions of their
own culture. Referring to the source of knowledge, the persistence in time, and the community support criteria for the
belief network does not provide conclusive answers either.
<br>
<h3>The questionary</h3>
<br>
Our alien is not aware of these conclusions just yet, and at this stage is still hopeful of finding a single, correct
description of the universe. To begin with, he singles out the story of Santa Claus (SC) as the least reliable and least
likely to be true. A number of arguments support this conclusion. Firstly, this story contradicts the common knowledge
of everyday experience. Whilst everyday experience may not be of a paramount significance in matters of establishing the
truth, the fact, for example, that no one has seen flying reindeer makes the whole story suspicious. Secondly, the story
contradicts the laws of physics (e.g. mass conservation, no action at the distance, finite speed of movement). Thirdly,
satellite images do not show any signs of SC at the North Pole. The video cameras he set during Christmas at random
locations around the globe have recorded multiple occasions of fraud - adults in the disguise of SC and pretending to be
SC. Based on all this evidence, he concludes with a high degree of confidence (but not 100%) that the story of SC is a
fake story. He was confused at first by a regular commotion occurring in certain societies during the Christmas period,
believing it to be a sign of some natural, objective phenomena, but then realised that all this was just a matter of
social conventions. When he cheated the villagers of one of the remote settlements by delaying Christmas for a day, no
one has noticed the trick thus conforming his hypothesis – the SC must be not real.
<br><br>
The situation becomes more delicate when it comes to discriminating between the worlds which adults believe to be true.
To start with, the alien makes up a short questionary which is meant to provide a brief overview of the key building
blocks of one’s world. In the disguise of a social scientist, he asks random people on streets to provide concise (less
than one-page) answers to the following questions
<ol>
<li>What does this world consists of (ontology)?</li>
<li>How does it work (cosmology)?</li>
<li>Why does it work this way? (metaphysics)</li>
<li>Who are you (identity)?</li>
<li>What do you do (practices)?</li>
<li>Why do you do it (values)?</li>
<li>Metanarrative</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
Figure 1.1 provides a schematic representation of this questionary.

<br> Figure 1.1 Schematic representation of the questionary
</center>
<br>
<br>
The first question (concerning ontology) is about enumerating and explaining major items in this universe. Clearly, you
may not be able to give an exhaustive description here. Furthermore, the meaning of some items in this list will remain
obscure until explained later, in other sections of the questionary, through the reference to the functions of this item
in the whole structure of the universe. Even so, you can tell that the world of a scientist consists of atoms and voids,
while the world of the religious person comprises divine entities and miracles. The general may say that the world is
divisible by alliances and potential threats.
<br><br>
The next task (concerning cosmology) is to specify the environment where your story unfolds. The story is usually about
people who live in the evolving world. You tell your audience how the bits, you have introduced earlier in the first
part of the questionary (ontology) interact with each other and evolve through time.
<br><br>
The third question (about metaphysics), asks why did you choose this particular description of the universe rather than
some other?
<br><br>
These first three questions (about ontology, cosmology and metaphysics) are predominantly about the external world. The
next three questions (about identity, practice, and values) narrow down this questionary towards the description of
specifically human affairs.
<br><br>
The “Identity” question is about specifying a human nature (or stating that there is no such thing as a human nature).
<br><br>
The question about practices is to clarify what people in this universe do, and what they should or should not be doing.
<br><br>
The question of “Values” is about defining what is good and what is not-good. The body of the dry monochrome description
of the self and the universe in this section is dressed up into the colourful gown of moral sentiments and ethical
perspectives.
<br><br>
The last, seventh, section of this questionary is about a mertanarrative which integrates all the previous questions
into one comprehensive whole and tells a story about the self and the world. The questionary without metanarrative could
be a collection of fragmented stories, with minimal cohesion in between, and perhaps even some contradiction present.
The metanarrative unites these stories, brushes out obvious contradictions, and provides one out of many other possible
interpretations of the collection.
<br><br>
After giving it some thought, most people (except professional philosophers) are able to fill up this questionary and
provide a short narrative description of the universe and themselves. The philosophers become stuck on the first
question and do not make much progress on the rest. Non-philosophers are more productive. In general, texts they write
are more-or-less coherent, conveying some kind of a story. When it comes to details, however, all these stories are
vague and imprecise, often operating with poorly defined terms.
<br><br>
Our alien collects these stories into distinct classes representing communities of scientists, priests, warriors etc. He
suspects that these stories may represent parallel worlds which people either used to live or have some ability to
perceive.
<br>
<h3>Web-narrative</h3>

It is tempting to think of a metanarrative integrating the aforementioned questionary into a single story as the most
important, culminating point of the questionary. As if, one can discard all other questions and answers as soon as they
have contributed to the metanarrative description of the world. I believe, this perception is misleading. The collection
of stories created by people answering specific questions is not any less important than the metanarrative which
emanates from these stories. In fact, it might be more appropriate to think of the metanarrative as one of the stories
in the collection rather than a culminating, the final product of the questionary.
<br><br>
The collection of stories is not reducible to a single narrative for a number of reasons. First of all, there is no
one-to-one correspondence between the questionary and the metanarrative and, having a collection of stories as a
background material, one may devise different metanarratives from this collection. One single metanarrative does not
provide complete account of all stories generated by the questionary. Discarding the questionary after having completed
the metanarrative, would lead to a dramatic loss of information. Imagine substituting all science literature including
papers by different schools of scientific thought with a single story about the science which does not consider rival
theories and hypothesis.
<br><br>
Secondly, the collection of stories associated with this questionary represents a dynamic body of knowledge which can
grow and evolve with time in many different shapes and directions. A single story or a metanarrative is essentially a
complete and static entity. It has a beginning, body, and a conclusion. It documents biographies that start at the birth
date (introduction), follow through the life time (the main body), and finish with the grave tomb (conclusion). A sequel
will undoubtedly be a story about someone else; the original main hero is dead. Conversely, the collection of stories
derived from the questionary is always open ended, because it is never complete, and can grow forever. Background
materials set by the previous authors provide some channelling of new developments, but the whole structure is so rich
and flexible that can easily accommodate new stories.
<br><br>
Each question of this questionary does not specify a clear cut, isolated area of the enquiry. Instead, answers to
different questions are likely to overlap with each other. For instance, in some stories (e.g. Buddhism) cosmology and
psychology are so tightly entangled it is near impossible to draw a line separating one from another. Subsequently, the
description of cosmology is incomplete unless you provide some details concerning psychology and vice versa to explain
psychology one has to elucidate cosmology. To make these descriptions meaningful, you will have to either integrate them
into a single narrative (that would filter out major inconsistencies) or, alternatively, leave them separate but still
tentatively connected by the fact of their belonging to the same collection of stories.
<br><br>
Unlike a narrative structure, the collection of stories may not be self-consistent. Different narratives in this
collection may tell contradicting stories. Because of these inconsistencies, the whole body of knowledge based on these
stories is more flexible and suitable for new developments.
<br><br>
The Vedas, Buddist texts, the Bible, and science literature exemplify such collections of stories. These stories could
be written on a paper, or they can be stored on the Internet. Sometimes they are maintained and transmitted orally from
one generation to another. Regardless of the form of their expression, these collections are irreducible in a sense that
no one single story (e.g. metanarrative) gives a complete description of the subject. There might be a lot of redundancy
present in these stories conducive to contradictions. There is typically no single author but many. The story writing
can take ages (hundreds and thousands of years).
<br><br>
A feature characteristic of such a collection of stories is its conceptual completeness in a sense that it must have
resources to accommodate and evaluate the truth value of any statement. Any enquiry about the self and the universe must
receive a proper handling within this structure. Not all questions will be answered, but the critical point is that this
collection must provide a conceptual background which makes it possible to handle every question whatever vocabulary is
used to formulate it.
<br><br>
The size and completeness of that collection could vary with time. The volume of scientific knowledge, for instance,
nowadays is much bigger than that a few hundred years ago. How much of this knowledge is internalised by a particular
person varies from one individual to another and within a single individual at different stages of his life.
To distinguish these particular collections of stories from many other forms of writings, we should name them. The word
metanarrative does not seem to be appropriate because in many cases, I think, people use it to describe a big narrative
rather than something qualitatively different from a narrative. The name “web-narrative” is too general because it
includes narratives on any subject while our collections are specifically about descriptions of the world. The best
name, I can think of, is “Storied World” (SW). In the rest of this manuscript we will use this name (Storied World) to
refer to such collections of stories.
<br><br>

<h3>On the method</h3>

Because of the all-inclusive nature of the SW, the method of dealing with such a complete body of knowledge has some
peculiarities. According to scientific method, you formulate a hypothesis, test it against established knowledge and
then depending on the outcomes of that test either accept or reject that hypothesis. In our all–inclusive collection of
stories the body of the hypothesis comprises the whole world, and hence no knowledge is left beyond that body to test it
against. There is no such thing as established knowledge residing beyond that storied-world (which itself is our
hypothesis), and if one storied-world contradicts another, there is no reference point beyond the body of the hypothesis
to establish its truth value. Unless, of course, we are prepared to postulate some privileged knowledge and methods of
dealing with such knowledge. These privileged methods and knowledge, once established, must be taken for granted and
never questioned afterwards.
<br><br>
Consider as an example the story of the “Big-Bang”. This story does not make sense within some religious interpretations
of the world, and it makes perfect sense within the scientific interpretation. In either case the truth value of that
story is assessed against a larger body of knowledge formed by a particular SW. If we want our truth allocations to be
more objective so that we can compare two different stories from the vantage point of some “impartial” observer, not
attached to any particular SW, then we have to step outside of every possible SW. Outside storied-worlds there is no
language, meaning that we have no principles whatsoever to guide our decisions. What can we do? If we don’t want to
succumb to the existential vacuum, we have to postulate rules, perhaps, grounded into some minimalistic collection of
stories. These rules would provide us criteria to rank other stories (see Gadamer’s “Truth and Method” for in depth
analysis of this subject).
<br><br>
So, what kind of rules may we implement in order to rank different storied-worlds? For example, we may insist that each
SW must comprise a self-consistent collection of stories, plus these stories must be consistent with an empirical
knowledge shared among all (or almost all) SWs. We may also require this knowledge to be relevant to our practices. It
could make sense to suggest that rules must pertain to ethical principles, or have something to do with our quality of
life, or the notion of sacred, etc. These rules would provide criteria to rank existing storied-worlds. The same rules
can be used to channel the development of new storied-worlds. In this case they would impose constraints on the kind of
storied-worlds we want to create.
<br><br>
Why did we choose these specific rules rather than some other rules? We did say earlier it is up to us to postulate
these rules, however, the choice is not completely arbitrary and it makes sense to provide some, at least tentative,
reasons for our decision. Let’s consider a few examples. Some people may argue that only those stories which promote the
well-being of cows are valid, because cows are much more important, in their eyes, than any other species on the planet
including human beings. We just feel this way – they say - we have been born with this feeling; it is part of the human
nature to feel that cows are superior to mankind. Yet, in this manuscript I have chosen some other criteria that say
nothing about cows, and instead talk about consistency, evidence, well-being, etc etc. Why did I miss cows? I think, the
key rationale for choosing this particular set of rules is grounded in our concerns with the quality of the life and the
well-being of human beings rather than any other species. Deep-down inside many people think they are more important
than cows. I am not sure why they think so. It may have something to do with our physiology or psychology, perhaps,
being established through the evolutionary selection. We are more concerned with ourselves rather than with others. But
this is not the whole story. Even if we set cows aside and focus on human beings, we still do not have a unique set of
rules and will have to choose one out of many other possible sets. Why did we choose this set rather than the other one?
I can refer to some aesthetic considerations or to “unreasonable efficiency” of the logically-consistent bodies of
knowledge or make references to the quality of life of human beings. But then the red-haired people will claim their own
special rules, which are superior to my rules because they are offered by the red-heired people and the read-heired
people are superior to all other people. They just feel it this way. In this scenario, all my arguments, which stem from
the concerns about all human-beings, fail. New arguments will fuel new discussions which can go forever.
<br><br>
To save time, I will just cut it out here and postulate the aforementioned principles guiding the development of new
stories. I believe, these principles are sufficiently general to let us analyse and develop rich variety of new SWs, on
the one hand, and, on the other hand, they are sufficiently constraining to cut out unwanted entries. We will elaborate
further on these principles through chapters 1 to 3 to make them more convincing. The critical point to remember,
however, is that the rationale behind them is never watertight. There is always place for an alternative set of rules
that would provide other means for ranking different storied-worlds. On the other hand, the choice is never completely
arbitrary. To be sustainable, a SW must respect at least some norms of ethics and be consistent with the laws of
physics. In other words, vocabularies do not exhaust the whole world. There are practices and experiences that transcend
stories and open the door towards other realities in our lives which surpass linguistics and may provide extra anchoring
points to justify our vocabularies.

<h3>Contradictions</h3>

Our alien expects the true description of the world to be self-consistent, meaning that different parts of such
description must not contradict each other. Sometimes we refer to such descriptions as coherent stories. Both people and
aliens like their stories to be expressed in a coherent form. Such stories narrow down the manifold of possible
interpretations of the world to a very specific one, we tend to call truth. In a self-consistent story, you and your
friend start from the same premises and arrive to the same conclusions. From the management perspective having one
single description of the world helps a manager to decide the best course of actions. Coherent stories also help people
to communicate with each other - if a story is inconsistent we often say it does not make sense.
<br><br>
Yet, the stories we tell about ourselves and the world around us are often infested with contradictions. The degree of
the logical cohesion present in these stories and the attitude towards contradictions varies from one storied-world to
another. In the world of science, for example, contradictions are typically considered a negative feature, introduced
pests, to be eradicated. The smaller the number of contradictions the better the theory. On the other hand, in some
religious schools (e.g. Zen Buddhism, Taoism), contradictions are the critical and irreducible parts of the teaching.
Get rid of all contradictions and you destroy the teaching.
<br><br>
Despite inconsistencies permeating our foundational beliefs, we still believe and rely on them in our daily lives. To
shed some light on such “unreasonable” behaviour of the believers, let me draw an analogy here between contradictions in
our beliefs and error-bugs (read “contradictions”) in computer programs. Typically, every complex computer program (and
especially the new one) has some bugs in it. To get rid of the most critical bugs, programmers run procedures called
debugging. The purpose of the debugging is to reach the point where the code becomes sufficiently stable to run. There
are still bugs in it, and they may show up in some extreme scenarios (beyond the envisaged range of applications), but
as long as we conduct routine simulations, the code is stable and the simulated data is useful - you can play and
experiment with it and improve this code later if needed. Analogously, there are contradictions (bugs) in stories we
tell about ourselves and the world around us. However, as long as these contradictions do not interfere with our day to
day practices, we are happy to ignore them and consider these stories to be reliable, believable, useful etc.
<br><br>
The word contradiction could be referring to contradictions between two statements (e.g. one statement saying “this is
white”, and another statement saying “this is black”), contradictions between theory and experimental evidence (theory
says “this is white”, but we can see it is black), contradictions between intentions and practices (he wants to maintain
healthy life-style but smokes), contradictions in psychological states (he does not know what he wants), or
contradictions in politics (the government wants us to live in peace and to achieve this goal builds up military
powers), social life (individual vs collective goods). People often genuinely believe in contradictory statements (in 7
days creation story and in paleontology). Furthermore, our beliefs are not consistent in time. Take the same person at
different age: kid, teenager, and an adult. They all believe in different things (as if they are different persons or
they live in different “worlds”). Paulo Coelho expressed really well the ubiquitous nature of contradictions in our
lives - “we are in such a hurry to grow up, and then we long for our lost childhood. We make ourselves ill earning
money, and then spend all our money on getting well again. We think so much about the future that we neglect the
present, and thus experience neither the present nor the future. We live as if we were never going to die and die as if
we had never lived.”
<br><br>
Rigorous definition of the word “contradiction” is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Typically, when we talk about a
contradiction, we refer to at least two items that contradict to each other. A succinct definition of “contradiction”
that would serve our purpose in this manuscript could be something like that: two statements are contradictory if we
cannot believe in both. In what follows I will give some examples of what is commonly considered a contradiction and, I
hope, we will be able to generalise these examples to other cases. I will consider words “coherence”, ”consistency”, and
“non-contradictory” as synonyms.
<br><br>
Our major focus in this section is on contradictions in stories we tell about ourselves and the external world. The
point I shall illustrate is that all these stories have some degree of logical cohesion and structure present, but
neither of them is perfect - there are logical inconsistencies present in all these stories. Furthermore, these
contradictions often represent critical and irreducible parts of the story line. Without those contradictions the story
would not make sense.
<br><br>
In the rest of this section I shall give an outline of a few storied-worlds and highlight some inconsistencies inherent
to them. Clearly, I will not be able to reproduce in this volume the whole breadth and depth of the full storied-world.
That would require, for example, writing up all key science papers and manuscripts, or presenting the manifold of
biblical stories and various traditions and customs associated with it. My task is to provide a bare minimum collection
of stories to infuse our discussion with a concrete materials and examples.
