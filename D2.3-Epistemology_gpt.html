In the previous chapters, we explored various "storied-worlds" from science to religion, each offering its unique
perspective yet none fully complete. This chapter will focus on epistemology—the study of knowledge. We'll look at
different ways people justify their knowledge claims and how these definitions of knowledge are not fixed, but rather
shaped by our needs and the challenges we face.

<h4 id="subtitle1">Epistemology Basics</h4>
Epistemology examines how we distinguish true knowledge from mere belief. It asks: What is knowledge? Can we truly know
anything? How do we obtain knowledge? Are there things we can never fully know? These questions help us explore not just
knowledge but also the aims and limits of different ways of thinking.
<h4 id="subtitle2">Gettier’s Problem</h4>
The classical idea that knowledge is "Justified True Belief" (JTB) has been criticized through what's known as Gettier’s
problem. This problem challenges the JTB definition by suggesting that there are cases where someone might have a
justified true belief that we would still not consider to be knowledge.
<h4 id="subtitle3">Method</h4>
Defining knowledge typically involves a blend of subjective judgment and objective criteria. We create general
definitions based on our experiences and test them against specific examples. This process helps us refine our
understanding of what knowledge is, although it's constantly evolving with new insights.
<h4 id="subtitle4">Justification Issues</h4>
Justifying knowledge involves different approaches, such as linking beliefs to evidence (evidentialism) or assessing the
reliability of knowledge sources (externalism). Each approach has its strengths and challenges, reflecting the
complexity of determining what counts as true knowledge.
<h4 id="subtitle5">Reliability (Externalism)</h4>
Reliability in knowledge claims focuses on the trustworthiness of information sources rather than direct evidence. For
instance, we often accept scientific facts without firsthand verification, relying instead on the credibility of the
scientific community.
<h4 id="subtitle6">Evidentialism (Internalism) - Foundationalism and Coherentism</h4>
Evidentialism ties beliefs to evidence directly supporting them. Foundationalism suggests some beliefs are "basic" and
need no further justification, while coherentism proposes that beliefs are justified if they fit coherently with other
beliefs. Both face criticisms, particularly on how they incorporate or overlook empirical evidence.
<h4 id="subtitle7">Other Epistemological Concepts</h4>
This section covers various epistemological theories that challenge traditional views, such as skepticism, which denies
the possibility of certain knowledge, and naturalism, which aligns epistemology more closely with empirical science.
<h4 id="subtitle8">Trends in Epistemology</h4>
Epistemology has evolved from seeking absolute, unchangeable truths to a more nuanced understanding that embraces the
fallibility and contextual nature of knowledge. This reflects a broader shift towards acknowledging the practical and
social dimensions of knowing.
<h4 id="subtitle9">Richard Rorty’s Pragmatic Relativism</h4>
Richard Rorty argues against traditional epistemology, suggesting that knowledge is not an objective truth to be
discovered but a construct shaped by society and language. He emphasizes practical cooperation over abstract accuracy in
knowledge claims.
<h4 id="subtitle10">Concluding Comments</h4>
This section highlights that while we set standards for what counts as knowledge, these standards are influenced by our
needs and interests. They're not arbitrary but are designed to balance practicality with accuracy, reflecting our
broader epistemic goals.
