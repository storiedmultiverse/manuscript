<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ol>
<li>According to SM, the whole world is a kind of a social construct. All natural, social and metaphysical entities are
designed, instantiated, and maintained collectively by all people via the ISO machinery.
</li>
<li>
The ISO machinery implies existence of the logically-cohesive stories (hypotheses, theories, models, propositions) in
the realm of abstract forms. Some of these stories are instantiated via human practices. The process of the
instantiation creates new particulars extending the established body of the empirical knowledge
(ie knowledge derived via observation). Conversely, when the empirical knowledge is
lost, the corresponding particulars disintegrate into the state of abstract entities (superposition of
hypothetical states).
</li>
<li>
SM is plausible – the power of arguments underpinning this theory, I think, is compatible to the strength of
arguments of many other storied-worlds.
</li>
<li>
SM is not exclusive - there are other epistemologically plausible descriptions of the world. For an individual to
internalise one of such descriptions, non-epistemological factors will play a critical role (e.g. upbringing, culture,
media, education, idiosyncratic preferences etcetera).

<h4>Take home points</h4>
<ol>
<li> When it comes to fundamental questions concerning the human nature and the functioning of the universe, 
many people are caught up in the web of stereotypes and never bother questioning these stereotypes - they don’t scratch
them hard enough to see there is nothing fundamental beneath. Furthermore, some people just don’t care to know who they
are and where they live. According to SM, our current believes and practices define our past, present, and future
lives, including our afterlife. We die as we live. Don’t risk it - take care of yourself.
</li>
<li>
According to SM, there is no such thing as the only real world. Instead, there are many different all equally real
worlds. People can migrate from one world to another or even create their own worlds tailored to their own needs.
Beware, however, of the dangers accompanying the exploration of the new worlds – however meticulous design, you never
know exactly what you will run into. If in doubt, don’t risk it – stick with the established storied-world proved by
time.

<li>
Multiverse travellers must have immunity against the existential void via the development of 
a prior sustainable well-being.

<h4>The alien</h4>
Finally, he is getting somewhere. Storied multiverse and sizmarians is a good starting point – not
perfect yet, but good enough to build on and improve. Eventually it will
be solid enough for him to get back home or move on exploring other worlds. 
On the other hand - no rush - he likes this planet and got attached to shape-shifters. 
He pooled his blanket up,  wriggled a bit to make it snug and tight, switched off the lamp 
and fell asleep - calm, peaceful and light – there will be another good day tomorrow.
