<h1> Introduction</h1>
</br>
Different cultures hold various belief systems that often contradict each other. To address these contradictions, some
people adopt the monoverse perspective, which argues that there is only one real world and, consequently, only one
accurate description of it. On the other hand, this manuscript introduces an alternative approach: the multiverse
perspective. This view suggests that there are multiple worlds, each with their own valid and credible descriptions.

</br>
</br>
In this manuscript, I will argue that the multiverse viewpoint is just as plausible as the monoverse viewpoint from an
epistemological standpoint. In other words, the strength of the logically sound arguments supporting the multiverse matches those in
favor of the monoverse. Moreover, I believe also the multiverse theory surpasses the monoverse in terms of aesthetic appeal,
openness to innovation, and practical utility. The multiverse theory offers a comprehensive framework that encompasses
individual belief systems and reconciles them, making it especially well-suited for multicultural societies.

</br>
</br>

To develop this multiverse framework, I will introduce a concept called the Instantiated Storied Object (ISO) machinery,
which outlines the structure and function of the multiverse. According to the ISO
machinery to create a new entity — whether an item or an entire artificial world — one needs to design it,
implement that design, and then test and maintain it. This method works well for artificial systems like physical
aggregates and social constructs, but not for natural systems. To extend this approach towards natural systems, I will
introduce several assumptions and constraints focused on the ontological underpinnings of the multiverse. The outcome
is an systematic approach underpinning the development of a diverse multiverse made up of various belief systems and communities 
of practitioners. Unlike the monoverse perspective, which asserts that only one world
is real, the multiverse model recognizes multiple worlds as equally real, each with its own distinct features such as
gods, afterlives, and customs. Additionally, new artificial worlds can be designed and instantiated if needed to extend 
the manifold of the established worlds.

</br></br>
Despite a fair bit of philosophy present in this manuscript, I am not a professional
philosopher and the lack of the systematic education in this area is likely to be noticeable throughout this book. The
text could be missing important references or it may focus on issues considered trivial by professional philosophers. 
On the other
hand, it was never my intention to write another philosophical treatise. The goal was to clarify (to myself primarily) 
what we know about ourselves and the world around us, how much unknown still exists out there,  
and how to design a better description of ourselves and the external environment.
</br></br>

This manuscript examines complex and often contentious philosophical issues regarding the epistemological and
metaphysical foundations of our beliefs. Faced with the broad scope of these topics, I had two options: focus
deeply on a single aspect of the theory, or try to develop the entire framework at once. Choosing the former could lead
to a well-articulated but potentially isolated part of the theory, while the latter risked creating an overarching but
underdeveloped framework. I opted for the second approach, aiming to lay down the groundwork for a comprehensive
multiverse framework. This initial version weaves together key concepts into a coherent structure, yet it is still
evolving and requires further refinement. As of May 2024, this manuscript has not been edited or peer-reviewed.

Many thinkers have shaped the development of this book. Works like Richard Rorty's "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature"
and "Contingency, Irony and Solidarity" challenged my views on epistemology's foundational role. Alasdair MacIntyre's
"After Virtue" introduced me to virtue ethics, and Peter Berger’s "The Social Construction of Reality" greatly
influenced the conceptualization of the multiverse. I am grateful to these and other authors mentioned throughout this
text for guiding my thinking and inspiring new ideas. Special thanks also go to my family, whose support was essential
in completing this project.

Outline of the content 
</br></br>
The book consists of this Introduction, 5 chapters, Appendixes and References. 
Chapter 1 defines the notion of the Storied World - a building block of the multiverse, 
and illustrates it through a number of examples (presented in Appendixes D1).
These examples combined with a general understanding of fundamental problems of philosophy 
(Appendixes D2) highlight an irreducible uncertainty inherent to ontological, epistemological, and ethical 
foundations of our belief systems. 

<br><br>
In Chapter 2 we introduce our definition of real entities that is both general enough to encompass a 
broad range of storied worlds, and sufficiently specific to discriminate between real and fake worlds.

<br><br>
In Chapter 3, the definition of the real entity is combined with a 
specific structure and functioning of the storied multiverse to create 
the Generalized Instantiated Storied Object (GISO) machinery - 
the engin driving the development of storied worlds. 

<br><br>
Chapter 4 highlights sustainable well-being as the key delivery anticipated from a storied-world, 
and emphasizes the role of virtues as a means to achieving this well-being. 
Various virtue keys open various doors of multiverse.  
It also points to a psychological dimension inherent to the multiverse travel and 
introduces sizmarians - the inhabitants of the multiverse. 

<br><br>
Chapter 5 gives a short overview of established multiverse theories and 
summarizes arguments for and against the Storied Multiverse. 

<br><br>
Chapter 6 concludes this manuscript.


<br><br>
Appendix D1 provides examples of established storied worlds of science, Christian and Buddhist traditions, 
and the world of stoics. 
<br><br>

Appendix D2, begins by exploring arguments for and against physical reductionism, followed by an in-depth outlook of
metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. The content in this chapter draws from university-level philosophy textbooks.
The goal is to highlight a normative component inherent to
many problems in philosophy thus contributing to their ampliative nature
(i.e. conclusions often going beyond of what is contained in premises).
The ethics section introduces the concepts of virtues and the good life. These
ideas complement the notion of truth and reflect the quality of the storied worlds that make up the multiverse.
