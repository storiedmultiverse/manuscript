<p>Scientists and engineers use numerical models like Earth system models, weather forecasts, and ecosystem models to
    understand natural environments and predict their future. These models help create various "what-if" scenarios for
    decision-making. The language of these models is mathematical, and their results are expressed through data fields
    that change over time.</p>
<p>The main argument in this section is that even in natural systems, where we generally know what counts as evidence
    and can test models against observations, we rarely have a single, definitive model. Instead, we often end up with a
    range of plausible interpretations.</p>
<p>This problem becomes even more pronounced outside of natural sciences. In areas like social sciences, it's often
    unclear what should be counted as evidence, complicating the task of selecting the right theoretical model.</p>
<h4 id="subtitle1">Scientific Interpretations</h4>
<p>In the future, physicists may develop a "theory of everything" that could predict all events from basic principles.
    However, whether such a theory is possible or practical remains a subject of debate. Currently, there are many
    theories, each suited to different phenomena and scales, which are used to solve problems across various fields.</p>
<p>These theories work well within specific academic domains where the systems being modeled are simpler, like physical
    or chemical systems. However, when models try to simulate more complex systems like human societies or ecosystems,
    they often incorporate multiple simpler models, which can introduce significant uncertainties.</p>
<p>Even if a model perfectly captures all known processes of an ecosystem and has perfect data, the sheer number of
    parameters can make it impossible to find the "best" set. This issue, known as the "curse of dimensionality,"
    suggests that even with unlimited computing power, some problems might remain unsolvable.</p>
<h4 id="subtitle2">Contingent Observations</h4>
<p>Complex systems in science are often modeled by an ensemble of simulations that each represent different possible
    futures. These models are not always consistent; they can predict very different outcomes based on the same starting
    conditions due to inherent uncertainties.</p>
<p>Observations, or empirical evidence, are supposed to provide a reality check against these models. However, defining
    what counts as a valid observation is not straightforward. Observations themselves are subject to interpretation and
    are shaped by the theoretical frameworks they are part of.</p>
<h4 id="subtitle3">Examples of Real Entities</h4>
<p>What counts as "real" varies greatly. Some consider only material objects like particles as real, while others
    include abstract concepts like numbers or even personal experiences like pain. Each definition of reality has its
    own criteria, which can include everything from being observable to being a fundamental part of the universe.</p>
<h4 id="subtitle4">Reductionism</h4>
<p>Reductionism is the idea that all complex systems can be understood by studying their simplest components. However,
    this approach has its limits. For example, knowing everything about individual air molecules might not help us
    predict the weather due to the chaotic nature of weather systems.</p>
<h4 id="subtitle5">Irresponsible Reifications</h4>
<p>Some critics argue that many concepts treated as real are merely convenient summaries of more complex underlying
    realities. For instance, a university might be considered a collection of buildings and people rather than an entity
    with its own essence. This critique warns against assigning reality too freely, which can obscure more foundational
    truths.</p>
<p>In summary, while we use scientific models and observations to try and capture reality, both are inherently imperfect
    and influenced by theoretical assumptions. Understanding these limitations is crucial for navigating scientific and
    philosophical landscapes.
